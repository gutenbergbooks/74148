<p>David Lindall stirred uneasily in his sleep,
sighed, muttered, and presently became
partly awake. Thereupon he was conscious
that all was not as it had been when slumber
had overtaken him, for, beyond his closed
lids, the attic, which should have been as
dark at this hour as the inside of any pocket,
was illuminated. He opened his eyes. The
rafters a few feet above his head were visible
in a strange radiance. He raised himself on
an elbow, blinking and curious. The light
did not come from the room below, nor was
it the yellow glow of a pine-knot. No sound
came to him save the loud breathing of his
father and Obid, the servant, the former near
at hand, the latter at the other end of the
attic: no sound, that is, save the soft sighing
of the night breeze in the pines and hemlocks
at the eastern edge of the clearing. That was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
ever-present and so accustomed that David
had to listen hard to hear it. But this strange
red glow was new and disturbing, and now,
wide awake, the boy sought the explanation
of it and found it once his gaze had moved
to the north window.</p>

<p>Above the tops of the distant trees beyond
the plantation, the sky was like the mouth
of a furnace, and against the unearthly glow
the topmost branches of the taller trees
stood sharply, like forms cut from black paper.</p>

<p>“Father!” called the boy.</p>

<p>Nathan Lindall was awake on the instant.</p>

<p>“You called, David?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, father. The forest is afire!”</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis not the forest,” answered
Nathan Lindall when he had looked from
the window. “The woods are too damp at
this season, and I have never heard of the
Indians firing them save in the fall. ’Tis
some one’s house, lad, and I fear—” He
did not finish, but turned instead to Obid
Dawkin who had joined them. “What say
you, Obid?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“I say as you, master,” replied Obid in
his thin, rusty voice. “And ’tis the work of
the heathens, I doubt not. But whose house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
it may be I do not know, for it seems too
much east to be any in Sudbury, and—”</p>

<p>“And how far, think you?”</p>

<p>“Maybe four miles, sir, or maybe but two.
’Tis hard to say.”</p>

<p>“Three, then, Obid: and that brings us
to Master William Vernham’s, for none
other lies in that direction and so near.
Whether it be set afire by the Indians we
shall know in time. But don your clothing,
for there may be work for us, although I
misdoubt that we arrive in time.”</p>

<p>“And may I go with you, father?” asked
David eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nay, lad, for we must travel fast and
’twill be hard going. Do you bolt well the
door when we are gone and then go back to
bed. ’Tis nigh on three already and ’twill
soon be dawn. Art ready, Obid?”</p>

<p>“Nay, for Sathan has hidden my breeches,
Master Lindall,” grumbled the man, “and
without breeches I will not venture forth.”</p>

<p>“Do you find them quickly or a clout upon
your thick skull may aid you,” responded
Nathan Lindall grimly.</p>

<p>“I have them, master,” piped Obid hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Look, sir, the fire is dying out,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
David. “The sky is far less red, I think.”</p>

<p>“Maybe ’tis but a wild-goose chase we go
on,” replied his father, “and yet ’tis best
to go. David, do you slip down and set out
the muskets and see that there be ammunition
to hand. Doubtless in time this jabbering
knave will be clothed.”</p>

<p>“I be ready now, master! And as for jabbering—”</p>

<p>“Cease, cease, and get you down!”</p>

<p>A minute or two later David watched
their forms melt into the darkness beyond
the barn. Then, closing the door, he shot
home the heavy iron bolt and dropped the
stout oak bar as well. In the wide chimney-place
a few live embers glowed amidst the
gray ashes and he coaxed them to life with
the bellows and dropped splinters of resinous
pine upon them until a cheery fire was crackling
there. Then, rubbing out the lighted
knot against the stones of the hearth, he drew
a bench to the blaze and warmed himself,
for the night, although May was a week old,
was chill.</p>

<p>The room, which took up the whole lower
floor of the house, was nearly square, perhaps
six paces one way by seven the other.
The ceiling was low, so low that Nathan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
Lindall’s head but scantily escaped the
rough-hewn beams. The furnishings would
to-day be rude and scanty, but in the year
1675 they were considered proper and sufficient.
In fact Nathan Lindall’s dwelling was
rather better furnished than most of its kind.
The table and the two benches flanking it
had been fashioned in Boston by the best
cabinet-maker in the Colony. The four
chairs were comfortable and sightly, the
chest of drawers was finely carved and had
come over from England, and the few articles
that were of home manufacture were
well and strongly made. Six windows,
guarded by heavy shutters, gave light to the
room, and one end was almost entirely taken
up by the wide chimney-place. At the other
end a steep flight of steps led to the room
above, no more than an attic under the high
sloping roof.</p>

<p>David had lived in the house seven years,
and he was now sixteen, a tall, well-made
boy with pleasing countenance and ways
which, for having dwelt so long on the edge
of the wilderness, were older than his age
warranted. His father had taken up his grant
of one hundred acres in 1668, removing from
the Plymouth Colony after the death of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
wife. David’s recollection of his mother was
undimmed in spite of the more than eight
years that had passed, but, as he had been
but a small lad at the time of her death, his
memory of her, unlike his father’s, held little
pain. The grant, part woodland and part
meadow, lay sixteen miles from Boston and
north of Natick. It was a pleasant tract, with
much fine timber and a stream which, rising
in a spring-fed pond not far from the house,
meandered southward and ultimately entered
the Charles River. The river lay a long mile
to the east and was the highway on which
they traveled, whether to Boston or Dedham.</p>

<p>Nathan Lindall had brought some forty
acres of his land under cultivation, and for
the wheat, corn, and potatoes that he raised
found a ready market in Boston.</p>

<p>The household consisted of Nathan Lindall,
David, and Obid Dawkin. Obid had
come to the Colony many years before as a
“bond servant,” had served his term and
then hired to Master Lindall. In England he
had been a school-teacher, although of small
attainments, and now to his duties of helping
till and sow and harvest was added that of
instructing David. Considering the lack of
books, he had done none so badly, and David<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
possessed more of an education than was
common in those days for a boy of his position.
It may be said of Obid that he was a
better farmer than teacher and a better cook
than either!</p>

<p>It was a lonely life that David led, although
he was never lonesome. There was
work and study always, and play at times.
His play was hunting and fishing and fashioning
things with the few rude tools at hand.
Of hunting there was plenty, for at that time
and for many years later eastern Massachusetts
abounded in animals and birds valuable
for food as well as many others sought for
pelt or plumage. Red deer were plentiful,
and beyond the Sudbury Marshes only the
winter before some of the Natick Indians
had slain a moose of gigantic size. Wolves
caused much trouble to those who kept cattle
or sheep, and in Dedham a bounty of ten
shillings had lately been offered for such as
were killed within the town. Foxes, both red
and gray, raccoons, porcupines, woodchucks,
and rabbits were numerous, while the ponds
and streams supplied beavers, muskrats, and
otters. Bears there were, as well, and sometimes
panthers; and many lynxes and martens.
Turkeys, grouse, and pigeons were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
common, the latter flying in flocks of many
hundreds. Geese, swans, ducks, and cranes
and many smaller birds frequented streams
and marshes, and there were trout in the
brooks and bass, pickerel, and perch in the
ponds. At certain seasons the alewives ascended
the streams in thousands and were
literally scooped from the water to be used
as fertilizer.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, no dearth of flesh for
food nor skins for clothing so long as one
could shoot a gun, set a trap, or drop a hook.
Of traps David had many, and the south end
of the house was never without several skins
in process of curing. Larger game had fallen
to his prowess, for he had twice shot a bear
and once a panther: the skins of these lay
on the floor in evidence. He was a good shot,
but there was scant virtue in that at a time
when the use of the musket, both for hunting
and for defense against the Indians, was universal
amongst the settlers. Rather, he
prided himself on his skill in the making of
traps and snowshoes and such things as were
needed about the house. He had clever hands
for such work. He could draw, too, not very
skillfully, but so well that Obid could distinguish
at the first glance which was the pig<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
and which the ox! And at such times his
teacher would grumblingly regret that his
talent did not run more to the art of writing.
But, since Obid’s own signature looked more
like a rat’s nest than an autograph, the complaint
came none too well.</p>

<p>Sitting before the fire to-night, David followed
in thought the journey of his father
and Obid and wished himself with them.
Nathan Lindall had spoken truly when he
had predicted hard going, for the ice, which
still lay in the swamps because of an unseasonable
spell of frost the week gone, was too
thin to bear one and the trail to Master
Vernham’s must keep to the high ground and
the longer distance. The three miles, David
reflected, would become four ere the men
reached their destination, and in the darkness
the ill-defined trail through the woods
would be hard to follow. It was far easier
to sit here at home, toasting his knees, but
no boy of sixteen will choose ease before adventure,
and the possibility of the fire having
been set by the Indians suggested real adventure.</p>

<p>A year and more ago such a possibility
would have been little considered, for the
tribes had been long at peace with the colonists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
but to-day matters were changed. It
had been suspected for some time that Pometacom,
or <a href="#i_frontis">King Philip</a>, as he was called,
sachem of the Wampanoags, was secretly unfriendly
toward the English. Indeed, nearly
four years since he had been summoned to
Taunton and persuaded to sign articles of
submission, which he did with apparent good
grace, but with secret dissatisfaction. Real
uneasiness on the part of the English was not
bred, however, until the year before our
story. Then Sassamon, a Massachusett Indian
who had become a convert of John
Eliot’s at the village of Praying Indians at
Natick, brought word to Plymouth of intended
treachery by Philip. Sassamon had
been with Philip at Mount Hope acting as
his interpreter. Philip had learned of Sassamon’s
treachery and had caused his death.
Three Indians suspected of killing Sassamon
were apprehended, tried, convicted, and, in
June of the following year, executed. Of the
three one was a counselor of Philip’s, and
the latter, although avoiding any acts of hostility
pending the court’s decision, was bitterly
resentful and began to prepare for war.
During the winter various annoyances had
been visited upon the settlers by roaming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Indians. In some cases the savages were
known to be Wampanoags; in other cases
the friendly Indians of the villages and settlements
were suspected, perhaps often unjustly.
Even John Eliot’s disciples at Natick
did not escape suspicion. Rumors of threatening
signs were everywhere heard. Exaggerated
stories of Indian depredations traveled
about the sparsely settled districts.
From the south came the tale of disaffection
amongst the Narragansetts, and from the
north like rumors regarding the Abenakis.
There was a feeling of alarm everywhere
amongst the English, and even in Boston
there were timorous souls who feared an attack
on that town. As yet, however, nothing
untoward had occurred in the Massachusetts-Bay
Colony, and the only Indians that David
knew were harmless and frequently
rather sorry-looking specimens who led a
precarious existence by trading furs with the
English or who dwelt in the village at Natick.
Most of them were Nipmucks, although other
neighboring tribes were represented as well.
Save that they not infrequently stole from
his traps—sometimes taking trap as well as
catch—David knew nothing to the discredit
of the Indians. Often they came to the house,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
more often he ran across them on the river
or in the forest. Always they were friendly.
One or two he counted as friends; Monapikot,
a Pegan youth of near his own age who
dwelt at Natick, and Mattatanopet, or Joe
Tanopet as he was known, who came and
went as it pleased him, bartering skins for
food and tobacco, and who claimed to be the
son of a Wamesit chief; a claim very generally
discredited. It is not to be wondered
at, therefore, that David added a good seasoning
of salt to the tales of Indian unfriendliness,
nor that to-night he was little inclined
to lay the burning of William Vernham’s
house at the door of the savages.</p>

<p>And yet, since where there is much smoke
there must be some fire, he realized that
Obid’s surmise might hold more than prejudice.
Obid was firmly of the belief that the
Indian was little if any better than the beast
of the forest and had no sympathy with the
Reverend John Eliot’s earnest endeavors to
convert them to Christianity, arguing that an
Indian had no soul and that none, not even
John Eliot, could save what didn’t exist!
Nathan Lindall held opposite views both of
the Indian and of John Eliot’s efforts, and
many a long and warm argument took place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
about the fire of a winter evening, while David,
longing to champion his father’s contentions,
maintained the silence becoming one of
his years.</p>

<p>The fire dwindled and David presently became
aware of the chill, and, yawning,
climbed the stair and sought his bed with
many shivers at the touch of the cold clothing.
A fox barked in the distance, but save
for that all was silent. Northward the red
glow had faded from the sky and the blacker
darkness that precedes the first sign of dawn
wrapped the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<small>THE MEETING IN THE WOODS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was broad daylight when David awoke,
rudely summoned from slumber by the loud
tattoo on the door below. He tumbled sleepily
down the stair and admitted his father
and Obid, their boots wet with the dew that
hung sparkling in the pale sunlight from
every spray of sedge and blade of grass.
While Obid, setting aside his musket, began
the preparation of breakfast, David questioned
his father.</p>

<p>“By God’s favor ’twas not the house, David,
but the barn and a goodly store of hay
that was burned. Fortunately these were
far enough away so that the flames but
scorched the house. Master Vernham and
the servants drew water from the well and
so kept the roof wet. The worst of it was
over ere we arrived. Some folks from the settlement
at Sudbury came also: John Longstaff
and a Master Warren, of Salem, who is
on a visit there, and two Indians.”</p>

<p>“How did the fire catch, sir?” asked David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>“’Twas set,” replied Nathan Lindall
grimly. “Indians were seen skulking about
the woods late in the afternoon, and ’tis
thought they were some that have set up their
wigwams above the Beaver Pond since
autumn.”</p>

<p>“But why, sir?”</p>

<p>“I know not, save that Master Vernham
tells me that of late they have shown much
insolence and have frequently come to his
house begging for food and cloth. At first he
gave, but soon their importunity wearied
him and he refused. They are, he says, a
povern and worthless lot; renegade Mohegans
he thinks. But dress yourself, lad, and
be about your duties.”</p>

<p>Shortly after the midday meal, Nathan
Lindall and Obid again set forth, this time
taking the Sudbury path, and David, left to
his own devices, finished the ploughing of the
south field which was later to be sown to
corn, and then, unyoking the oxen and returning
them to the barn, he took his gun
and made his way along the little brook
toward the swamp woods. The afternoon,
half gone, was warm and still, and a bluish
haze lay over the distant hills to the southeast.
A rabbit sprang up from almost beneath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
his feet as he entered the white birch
and alder thicket, but he forbore to shoot,
since its flesh was not esteemed as food and
the pelt was too soft for use at that season
of the year. For that matter, there was little
game worth the taking in May, and David
had brought his gun with him more from
force of habit than aught else. It was enough
to be abroad on such a day, for the spring
was waking the world and it seemed that he
could almost see the tender young leaves of
the white birches unfold. Birds chattered
and sang as he skirted the marsh and approached
the deeper forest beyond. A chestnut
stump had been clawed but recently by
a bear in search of the fat white worms that
dwelt in the decaying wood, and David
found the prints of the beast’s paws and followed
them until they became lost in the
swamp. Turning back, his ears detected the
rustling of feet on the dead leaves a few rods
distant, and he paused and peered through
the greening forest. After a moment an Indian
came into view, a rather thick-set,
middle-aged savage with a round countenance.
He wore the English clothes save
that his feet were fitted to moccasins instead
of shoes and had no doublet above a frayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
and stained waistcoat that had once been
bright green. Nor did he wear any hat, but,
instead, three blue feathers woven into his
hair. He carried a bow and arrows and a
hunting-knife hung at his girdle. A string
of wampum encircled his neck. That he had
seen David as soon as David had seen him
was evident, for his hand was already raised
in greeting.</p>

<p>“’Tis you, Tanopet,” called David. “For
the moment I took you for the bear that has
been dining at yonder stump.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” grunted the Indian, approaching.
“Greeting, brother. Where see bear?”</p>

<p>David explained, Joe Tanopet listening
gravely the while. Then, “No good,” he
said. “No catch um in swamp. What shoot,
David?” He pointed to the boy’s musket.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Joe. I brought gun along for
friend to talk to. Where you been so long?
You haven’t been here since winter.”</p>

<p>Tanopet’s gaze wandered and he waved a
hand vaguely. “Me go my people,” he
answered. “All very glad see me. Make
feast, make dance, make good time.”</p>

<p>“Is your father Big Chief still living,
Joe?”</p>

<p>“Aye, but um very old. Soon um die.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Then Joe be chief. How your father, David?”</p>

<p>“Well, I thank you; and so is Obid.”</p>

<p>Joe Tanopet scowled and spat.</p>

<p>“Um little man talk foolish, no good.
You see fire last night?”</p>

<p>“Aye. Father and Obid Dawkin went to
give aid, but the flames were out when they
reached Master Vernham’s. They say that
the fire was set, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Aye.”</p>

<p>“They suspect some Indians who have
been living near the Beaver Pond,” continued
David questioningly.</p>

<p>Joe Tanopet shook his head. “Not Beaver
Pond people.”</p>

<p>“Who then, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Maybe Manitou make fire,” replied the
Indian evasively.</p>

<p>“Man <em>or</em> two, rather,” laughed David.
“Anyhow, father and Obid have gone to
Sudbury where they are to confer with
others, and I fear it may go hard with the
Beaver Pond Indians. How do you know
that they did not set the fire, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Me know. You tell father me say.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but with no more proof than that I
fear ’twill make little difference,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the boy dubiously. “Joe, they say that there
are many strange Indians in the forest this
spring; that Mohegans have been seen as far
north as Meadfield. Is it true?”</p>

<p>“Me no see um Mohegans. Me see um
Wampanoags. Me see um Niantiks. Much
trouble soon. Maybe when leaves on trees.”</p>

<p>“Trouble? You mean King Philip?”</p>

<p>“Aye. Him bite um nails long time. Him
want um fight. Him great sachem. Him got
many friends. Much trouble in summer.”
Tanopet gazed past David as though seeing
a vision in the shadowed forest beyond.
“Big war soon, but no good. English win.
Philip listen bad counsel. Um squaw Wootonekanuske
tell um fight. Um Peebe tell
um fight. All um powwows tell um make
war. Tell um drive English into sea, no
come back here. All um lands belong Indians
once more. Philip um think so too. No
good. Wampanoags big fools. Me know.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are mistaken, Joe, for such a
war would be very foolish and very wrong.
That Philip has cause for complaint against
the Plymouth Colony I do not doubt, but it
is true, too, my father says, that he has failed
to abide by the promises he made. As for
driving the English out of the country, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
is indeed an idle dream, for now that the
Colonies are leagued together their strength
of arms is too great. Not all the Indian Nations
combined could bring that about.
Philip should take warning of what happened
to the Pequots forty years ago.”</p>

<p>“Um big war,” grunted Tanopet. “Many
Indians die. Joe um little boy, but um see.
Indians um fight arrow and spear, but now
um fight guns. English much kind to Indian.
Um sell um gun, um sell um bullet, um sell
um powder.” Tanopet’s wrinkled face was
slyly ironical. “Philip got plenty guns,
plenty bullet.”</p>

<p>“But how can that be, Joe? ’Tis but four
years gone that his guns were taken from
him.”</p>

<p>“Um catch more maybe. Maybe um not
give up all guns. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Tanopet made a sign of farewell, turned
and strode lightly away into the darkening
forest, and David, his gun across his shoulder,
sought his home, his thoughts busy with
what the Indian had said. Joe Tanopet was
held trustworthy by the colonists thereabouts,
and, since he was forever on the
move and having discourse with Indians of
many tribes, it might well be that his words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
were worthy of consideration. For the first
time David found reason to fear that the dismal
prophecies of Obid Dawkin might come
true. He determined to tell his father of Tanopet’s
talk when he returned.</p>

<p>But when David reached the house, he
found only Obid there, preparing supper.</p>

<p>“Master Lindall will not be back until the
morrow,” explained Obid. “He and Master
Vernham have gone to Boston with four Indians
that we made prisoners of, and who, I
pray, will be hung to the gallows-tree.”</p>

<p>“Prisoners!” exclaimed David. “Mean
you that there has been fighting, then?”</p>

<p>“Fighting? Nay, the infidels had no
stomach for fighting. They surrendered
themselves readily enough, I promise, when
they saw in what force we had come. But
some had already gone away, doubtless having
warning of our intention, and only a
handful were there when we reached their
village. Squaws and children mostly, they
were, and there was great howling and dismay
when we burned the wigwams.”</p>

<p>“But is it known, Obid, that it was indeed
they who did the mischief to Master Vernham’s
place?”</p>

<p>“Well enough, Master David. They made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
denial, but so they would in any case, and
always do. One brave who appeared to be
their leader—his name is Noosawah, an I
have it right—told a wild tale of strange
Indians from the north and how they had
been seen near the High Hill two days since,
and proclaimed his innocence most loudly.”</p>

<p>“And might he not have been telling the
truth?”</p>

<p>“’Tis thought not, Master David. At
least, it was deemed best to disperse them,
for they were but a Gypsy-sort and would not
say plainly from whence they came.”</p>

<p>“It sounds not just,” protested David.
“Indeed, Obid, ’tis such acts that put us
English in the wrong and give grounds for
complaint to the savages. And now, when,
by all accounts, there is ill-feeling enough, I
say that it was badly done.”</p>

<p>Obid snorted indignantly. “Would you
put your judgment against that of your
father and Master Vernham and such men
of wisdom as John Grafton, of Sudbury, and
Richard Wight, Master David?”</p>

<p>“I know not,” answered David troubledly.
“And yet it seems to me that a gentler policy
were better. It may be that we shall
need all the friends we can secure before
many months, Obid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, but trustworthy friends, not these
Sons of Sathan who offer peace with one
hand and hide a knife in t’other! An I were
this Governor Leverett I would not wait, I
promise you, for the savages to strike the
first blow, but would fall upon them with all
the strength of the united Colonies and drive
the ungodly creatures from the face of the
earth.”</p>

<p>“Then it pleases me well that you are not
he,” laughed David as he sat himself to the
table. “But tell me, Obid, what of the Indians
that father and Master Vernham are
taking to Boston? Surely they will not execute
them on such poor evidence!”</p>

<p>“Nay,” grumbled Obid, “they will doubtless
be sold into the West Indies.”</p>

<p>“Sold as slaves? A hard sentence, methinks.
And the women and children, what
of them? You say the village was burned?”</p>

<p>“Aye, to the ground; and a seemly work,
too. The squaws and the children and a few
young men made off as fast as they might.
I doubt they will be seen hereabouts again,”
he concluded grimly. “For my part, I hold
that Master Lindall and the rest were far too
lenient, since they took but four prisoners,
they being the older men, and let all others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
go free. I thought to see Master Vernham
use better wisdom, but ’tis well known that
he has much respect for Preacher Eliot, and
doubtless hearkened to his intercessions. If
this Eliot chooses to waste his time teaching
the gospel to the savages, ’tis his own affair,
perchance, but ’twould be well for him to refrain
from interfering with affairs outside his
villages. Mark my words, Master David: if
trouble comes with Philip’s Indians these
wastrel hypocrites of Eliot’s will be murdering
us in our beds so soon as they get the
word.”</p>

<p>“That I do not believe,” answered David
stoutly.</p>

<p>“An your scalp dangles some day from
the belt of one of these same Praying Indians
you will believe,” replied Obid dryly.</p>

<p>Nathan Lindall returned in the afternoon
from Boston and heard David’s account of
his talk with Joe Tanopet in silence. Nathan
Lindall was a large man, well over six feet
in height and broad of shoulder, and David
promised to equal him for size ere he stopped
his growth. A quiet man he was, with calm
brown eyes deeply set and a grave countenance,
who could be stern when occasion
warranted, but who was at heart, as David<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
well knew, kind and even tender. He wore
his hair shorter than was then the prevailing
fashion, and his beard longer. His father, for
whom David was named, had come to the
Plymouth Colony from Lincolnshire, England,
in 1625, by profession a ship’s-carpenter,
and had married a woman of well-to-do
family in the Colony, thereafter setting up in
business there. Both he and his wife were now
dead, and of their children, a son and daughter,
only David’s father remained. The
daughter had married William Elkins, of
Boston, and there had been one child, Raph,
who still lived with his father near the
King’s Head Tavern. When David had
ended his recital, his father shook his head
as one in doubt.</p>

<p>“You did well to tell me, David,” he
said. “It may be that Tanopet speaks the
truth and that we are indeed destined to suffer
strife with the Indians, though I pray not.
In Boston I heard much talk of it, and there
are many there who fear for their safety. I
would that I had myself spoken with Tanopet.
Whither did he go?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, father. Should I meet
him again I will bid him see you.”</p>

<p>“Do so, for I doubt not he could tell much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
were he minded to, and whether Philip means
well or ill we shall be the better for knowing.
So certain are some of the settlers to the
south that war is brewing, according to your
Uncle William—with whom I spent the
night in Boston—that they even hesitate to
plant their fields this spring. Much foolish
and ungodly talk there is of strange portents,
too, with which I have no patience. Well, we
shall see what we shall see, my son, and
meanwhile there is work to be done. Did you
finish the south field?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father. The soil is yet too wet for
good ploughing save on the higher places.
What of the Indians you took to Boston, sir?
Obid prays that they be hung, but I do not,
since it seems to me that none has proven
their guilt.”</p>

<p>“They will be justly tried, David. If
deemed guilty they will doubtless be sold for
slaves. A harsher punishment would be fitter,
I think, for this is no time to quibble.
Stern measures alone have weight with the
Indians, so long as Justice dictates them.
Now be off to your duties ere it be too dark.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<small>DOWN THE WINDING RIVER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A fortnight later David set out early one
morning for Boston to make purchases.
Warm and dry weather had made fit the soil
for ploughing and tilling, and Nathan Lindall
and Obid were up to their necks in work,
and of the household David could best be
spared. He was to lodge overnight with his
Uncle William Elkins and return on the morrow.
The sun was just showing above the
trees to the eastward when he left the house
and made his way along the path that led to
the river. He wore his best doublet, as was
befitting the occasion, but for the rest had
clothed himself for the journey rather than
for the visit in the town. His musket lay in
the hollow of his arm and a leather bag
slung about his shoulder held both ammunition
and food.</p>

<p>His spirits were high as he left the clearing
behind and entered the winding path through
the forest of pines and hemlocks, maples and
beeches. The sunlight filtered through the
upper branches and laid a pattern of pale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
gold on the needle-carpeted ground. Birds
sang about him, and presently a covey of
partridges whirred into air beyond a beech
thicket. It was good to be alive on such a
morning, and better still to be adventuring,
and David’s heart sang as he strode blithely
along. The voyage down the river would be
pleasant, the town held much to excite interest,
and the visit to his uncle and cousin
would be delightful. He only wished that his
stay in the town was to be longer, for he and
Raph, who was two years his elder, were firm
friends, and the infrequent occasions spent
with his cousin were always the most enjoyable
of his life. This morning he refused to
think of the trip back when, with a laden
canoe, he would have to toil hard against the
current. The immediate future was enough.
Midges were abroad and attacked him bloodthirstily,
but he plucked a hemlock spray and
fought them off until, presently, the path
ended at the bank of the river, here narrow
and swift and to-day swollen with the spring
freshets. Concealed under the trees near by
lay a bark canoe and a pair of paddles, and
David soon had the craft afloat and, his gun
and bag at his feet, was guiding it down the
stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>The sun was well up by the time he had
passed the first turns and entered the lake
above Nonantum which was well over a half-mile
in width, although it seemed less because
of a large island that lay near its lower
end. There were several deserted wigwams
built of poles and bark on the shores of the
island, left by Indians who a few years before
had dwelt there to fish. David used his paddle
now, for the current was lost when the
river widened, and, keeping close to the
nearer shore, glided from sunlight to shadow,
humming a tune as he went. Once he surprised
a young deer drinking where a meadow
stretched down to the river, and was
within a few rods of him before he took
alarm and went bounding into a coppice.
Again the river narrowed and he laid the
paddle over the side as a rudder. A clearing
running well back from the stream
showed a dwelling of logs, and a yellow-and-white
dog barked at him from beside the
doorway. Then the tall trees closed in again
and the swift water was shadowed and looked
black beneath the banks.</p>

<p>At noon, then well below the settlement
at Watertown, David turned toward the
shore and ran the bow of the canoe up on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
little pebbly beach and ate the provender he
had brought. It was but bread and meat, but
hunger was an excellent sauce for it, and with
draughts of water scooped from the river in
his hand it was soon finished. Then, because
there was no haste needed and because the
sunshine was warm and pleasant, he leaned
back and dreamily watched the white clouds
float overhead, borne on a gentle southwesterly
breeze. Behind him the narrow beach
ended at a bank whereon alders and willows
and low trees made a thin hedge that partly
screened the wide expanse of fresh green
meadow that here followed the river for more
than five miles. Through it meandered little
brooks between muddy banks, and here and
there a rounded island of clustered oaks or
maples stood above the level of the marsh.
Swallows darted and from near at hand a
kingfisher cried harshly. David’s dreaming
was presently disturbed by the faint but unmistakable
<em>swish</em> of paddles and he raised
his head just as a canoe rounded a turn
downstream.</p>

<p>The craft held three Indians, of whom two,
paddling at bow and stern, were naked to the
waist save for beads and amulets worn about
the neck. The one who sat in the center was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
clothed in a garb that combined picturesquely
the Indian and the English fashions.
Deerskin trousers, a shirt of blue cotton
cloth, and a soft leather jacket made his attire.
He wore no ornaments, nor was his
bare head adorned in any way. A musket lay
across his knees and a long-stemmed pipe of
red clay was held to his lips. Before him
were several bundles. At sight of David he
raised a hand and then spoke to his companions,
and the canoe left the middle of
the stream and floated gently up to the
marge. David jumped eagerly from his own
craft and made toward the other.</p>

<p>“Pikot!” he called joyfully. “I had begun
to think you were lost. ’Tis moons since
I saw you last.”</p>

<p>“The heart sees when the eyes cannot,”
replied the Indian, smiling, as he leaped to
the beach and shook hands. “Often I have
said, ‘To-morrow I will take the Long Marsh
trail and visit my brother David’; but there
has been much work at the village all through
the winter, and the to-morrows I sought did
not come. Where do you go, my brother?”</p>

<p>“To Boston to buy seeds and food and
many things, Straight Arrow. And you?”</p>

<p>“To Natick with some goods for Master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Eliot that came from across the sea by ship.
All has been well with you, David?”</p>

<p>“Aye, but I am glad indeed that the winter
is over. I like it not. They say that in
Virginia the winters are neither so long nor
so severe, and I sometimes wish that we
dwelt there instead.”</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head. “I know
not of Virginia, but I know that my people
who live in the North are greater and
stronger and wiser than they who dwell in
the South. ’Tis the cold of winter that makes
strong and lean bodies. In summer we lose
our strength and become fat, wherefore God
divides the seasons wisely. I have something
to say to you, David. Come a little way
along the shore where it may not be overheard.”</p>

<p>David followed, viewing admiringly the
straight, slim figure of his friend. Monapikot
was a Pegan Indian. The Pegans were one
of the smaller tribes of the Abenakis who
lived southward in the region of Chaubunagunamog.
He was perhaps three years David’s
senior and had been born at Natick in
the village of the Praying Indians. Although
scarcely more than a lad in years, he was
already one of Master Eliot’s most trusted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
disciples and had recently become a teacher.
He spoke English well and could read it
fairly. He and David had been friends ever
since shortly after the latter’s arrival in that
vicinity, at which time David had been a boy
of nine years and Pikot twelve. They had
hunted together and lost themselves together
in the Long Marsh, and had had the usual
adventures and misadventures falling to the
lot of boys whether they be white or red. For
the last three years, though, Pikot’s duties
had held him closer to the village and their
meetings had been fewer. The Indian was a
splendid-looking youth, tall and straight—for
which David had once dubbed him
Straight Arrow—with hard, lean muscles
and a gracefulness that was like the swaying
litheness of a panther. His features were exceptional
for one of a tribe not usually endowed
with good looks, for his forehead was
broad, his eyes well apart, and his whole
countenance indicated nobility. His gaze
was direct and candid, and, which was unusual
in his people, his mouth curved
slightly upward at the corners, giving him
a less grave expression than most Indians
showed. Perhaps David had taught him to
laugh, or, at least, to smile, for he did so frequently.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Had there been more like Monapikot
amongst the five-score converts that
dwelt in Natick, there might well have been
a more universal sympathy toward John
Eliot’s efforts.</p>

<p>“When we were little,” began Pikot after
they had placed a hundred strides between
them and the two Indians in the canoe, “you
brought me safe from the water of the Great
Pond when I would have drowned, albeit you
were younger and smaller than I, my
brother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’tis true, Pikot, but the squirrel is
ever more clever than the woodchuck. Besides,
then the woodchuck snared himself in
a sunken tree root and, having not the sense
to gnaw himself free, must needs call on the
squirrel for aid.”</p>

<p>Pikot assented, but did not smile at the
other’s nonsense. Instead, he laid one slim
bronze-red hand against his heart. “You
saved the life of Monapikot and he does not
forget. Some day he will save the life of
David just so.”</p>

<p>“What? Then I shall keep out of the
water, Straight Arrow! I doubt not you
would bring me ashore as I brought you, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
suppose you happened not to be by? Nay,
I’ll take no risks, thank you!”</p>

<p>“I know not in what way you will be in
danger,” answered the Pegan gravely. “But
thrice I have dreamed the same dream, and
in the dream ’tis as I have told.”</p>

<p>“Methinks your dreams smack of this
witchcraft of which we hear so much of late,”
said David slyly, “and belong not to that
religion that you teach, Pikot.”</p>

<p>“Nay, for the Bible tells much of dreams.
Did not Joseph, when sold by his wicked
brothers in Egypt, tell truly what meant the
dreams of the great King? My people in
such way tell their dreams to the powwows,
and the powwows explain them. It may be
that dreams are the whisperings of the Great
Spirit. But listen, my brother, to a matter
that is of greater moment. Fifteen days ago
your father and Master Vernham made captive
three Indians and took them to Boston
where they now wait judgment of the court.
One is named Nausauwah, a young brave
who is a son of Woosonametipom, whose
lands are westward by the Lone Hill.”</p>

<p>“But my father thinks that they are Mohegans,
Pikot.”</p>

<p>“Nay, they are Wachoosetts. Nausauwah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
quarreled with Woosonametipom and came
hither in the fall with four tens of his people.
He is a lazy man and thought to find food
amongst the English. Now, albeit the Sachem
Woosonametipom did not try to hinder
Nausauwah from leaving the lodge of his
people, he is angry at what he has heard and
says that he will come with all his warriors
to Boston and recover his son. That is but
boasting, for albeit he is a great sachem and
has many warriors under him, and can count
on the Quaboags to aid him, mayhap, he
would not dare. But he has sworn a vengeance
against these who have taken his son,
David, and I fear he will seek to harm your
father and Master Vernham. Do not ask me
where I have learned this, but give warning
to your father and be ever on your guard.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Straight Arrow. My father
and Master William Vernham, though, had
no more to do with the taking of this Nausauwah
than many others. It but so happened
that they were chosen to convey the captives
to the authorities in Boston. What means,
think you, this Metipom will seek to get
vengeance?”</p>

<p>“He is not friendly to the English, my
brother, and it may be that he will be glad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of this reason to travel swiftly from his
mountain home and make pillage. But ’tis
more likely that he will send a few young
men eager to win honor by returning with
English scalps. Go not abroad alone, David,
and see that the house be well secured at
nightfall. The Wachoosetts are forest Indians
and swift and sly, and I fear for your
safety. It would be well to travel back in
company with another, or else to take a party
of Indians with you and see that they are
armed with guns. Should Woosonametipom’s
braves learn of your journey, I fear
they would make the most of it. I would
I could stay by you, but I must go on my
way at once.”</p>

<p>“But surely they would not dare their
deviltry so near the plantations!”</p>

<p>“Who knows?” Monapikot lapsed into
the Indian tongue, which David understood
a little and could speak haltingly to the extent
of being understood. “The fox takes
the goose where he finds him.”</p>

<p>“Then I will be no goose, Straight Arrow,
but rather the dog who slays the fox,”
laughed David.</p>

<p>Pikot smiled faintly. “You will ever be
Noawama, He Who Laughs, my brother.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
But see that while you laugh you close not
your eyes. Now I must go, for Master Eliot
awaits what I bring.”</p>

<p>“I will see you again soon, Pikot, for the
fish are hungry and none can coax them to
the hook as you can.”</p>

<p>“And none eat them as you can!”
chuckled Pikot. “Within seven sleeps I will
visit you and we will take food and go to
the Long Pond. Farewell, my brother.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, Pikot. May your food do you
much good.”</p>

<p>Monapikot stepped into his canoe, the Indians
grunted and pushed off, and David,
waving, watched the craft out of sight. Then
he launched his own canoe and again took up
his journey. Pikot’s warning held his
thoughts, although it did not seem to him
that this Wachoosett sagamore would dare
dispatch his assassins so far into the plantations.
As for any danger on the river, he
smiled at that. Already the village of Newtowne,
a good-sized settlement with many
proper houses and a mile-long fenced enclosure
about it, was in sight on the left of
the river, and Boston itself was but a good
four miles distant. But David told himself
that Pikot’s fears might have ground and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
that for a while at least it would be best to
be cautious. As soon as he returned home
he would repeat the Indian’s warning. He
smiled as he reflected on the alarm that it
would bring to Obid Dawkin.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon, skirting the mud
flats and oyster banks below the town, he
made landing at Blackstone’s Point, giving
his canoe into custody of an Indian who
dwelt in a hut close upon the water, and
made his way up the hill, there being nothing
in the way of a road save a cart track that
wound deviously. His way led him presently
along the slope of Valley Acre and thence
into Hanover Street above where stood the
house that had been the home of Governor
Endicott before his death ten years ago. To
David the sights and sounds of Boston were
engaging indeed, and it took him the better
part of an hour to complete his journey afoot.
Many windows must be looked into that he
might feast his eyes on the goods for sale
within, and the signs hanging above the narrow
streets were a never-failing source of interest.
Even the sober-visaged citizens held
his footsteps while he amused himself in
wondering about them. There were strangers
to be met as well, and these could be easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
distinguished, not only by their dress, but by
the more cheerful countenances that they
wore: ship’s captains and rolling-gaited sailors
redolent of tar and, he feared, rum as
well; Negroes and an occasional Indian;
dark men who wore gold rings in their ears.
But in the end he turned down toward the
shore and so into Ship Street and saw the
swinging sign of the King’s Head Tavern
ahead and was presently beating a gay tattoo
on the portal of Master William Elkins, Merchant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>THE SPOTTED ARROW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The rest of that day passed quickly and enjoyably,
for Raph Elkins took David under
his wing and, until it was time for the evening
meal, the two lads viewed the town and
loitered along the shore and wharves where
many ships were at anchor. Fascinating
odors filled their nostrils and romantic
sights held them enthralled. Perhaps Raph
was less engaged than David, for he was more
accustomed to the shipping, but he enjoyed
his cousin’s pleasure and through it found a
new enthusiasm. To David the sea and the
ships that sailed it had ever held a strong
appeal, and secretly he entertained the
longing that most boys have for the feel of a
swaying deck and for all the exciting adventures
that were supposed to befall—and frequently
did—the hardy mariners of those
days. Piracy was still a popular trade in
southern waters, and Teach and Bradish and
Bellamy, and even the renowned William
Kidd, were names to bring a romantic flutter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
to the heart of a healthy lad. Whether, could
he have had his way, David would have cast
his lot with the privateers—who were but
pirates under a more polite title—or with
those who sought to suppress them, I do not
know!</p>

<p>When they returned to the house, Master
William Elkins had returned and they sat
down to supper. David’s uncle was a somewhat
pompous man of forty-odd, very proper
as to dress and deportment, and who ruled
his household with a stern hand. Yet withal
he was kind of heart and secretly held David
in much affection. Since his wife’s death the
domestic affairs had been looked after by a
certain Mistress Fairdaye, who occupied a
position midway between that of servant and
housewife, taking her meals with the family
and ruling in her own realm quite as inflexibly
as Master Elkins commanded over all.
David often pitied Raph, for what between
his father and Mistress Fairdaye he spent
what seemed to the younger lad a very dreary
and suppressed existence. But Raph appeared
not to mind it. Indeed, unlike David,
he had little of the adventurous in his make-up
and restraint did not irk him. He was a
rather thick-set youth, quiet in manner and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
even sober, having doubtless found little to
make him otherwise in his staid life. Yet
when David was about he could be quite
lively and would enter into their mild adventures
with a fair grace.</p>

<p>Supper was a serious affair at Master
Elkins’s. After the blessing had been asked,
they set to in a silence that was seldom
broken until the meal was at an end. David,
who had experienced too much excitement to
be heartily hungry, was finished before the
rest and thereafter amused himself by kicking
Raph’s shins beneath the table, maintaining
an innocence of countenance that threw
no light on the squirmings of his cousin who,
in an effort to avoid punishment, called
down a reprimand from his father for his
unseemly antics.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was spent in conversation,
David delivering some messages
to his uncle from his father and recounting
the warning given by Monapikot and, in return,
listening to a lengthy discourse on the
political affairs of the Colony, much of which
he did not comprehend. It was decided,
though, by Master Elkins that David was not
to make the return journey alone, but that
three of the town Indians should accompany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
him. David took no pleasure from the decision,
for, as toilsome as the trip would have
been, he had looked forward to it eagerly,
anxious to put his strength and endurance
to the test. But his uncle was not one to be
disputed and David agreed to the arrangement
with the best face he could. Bedtime
came early, but, after he and Raph had put
out the candle in the little sloping-roofed
room at the top of the house, they talked for
a long while. Even then it was Raph who
first dropped off to slumber, and David lay
for some time more quite wide awake in the
darkness, watching through the little small-paned
window the twinkling lights on the
ships in the town cove.</p>

<p>His purchases were made by mid-morning
and at a little after ten o’clock Raph accompanied
him to Blackstone’s Point whither
the porters from the stores had borne his
goods and where three stolid and unattractive
Indians were awaiting. Raph bade him
farewell and repeated a promise to visit him
in the summer, and the canoe, propelled by
two of the savages, began its return voyage.
Since but one of his copper-skinned companions
carried a weapon, a battered flintlock,
David could not see that he was much safer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
from attack by hostiles than if he had made
the journey alone. The armed savage was
known as Isaac Trot, whatever his real name
may have been, and was an ancient, watery-eyed
Massachusett, one of the few remaining
remnants of that once numerous tribe. He
squatted forward of David, his gun across his
knees, and, save for a grunted word of direction
to the paddlers, gave all his attention to
his pipe.</p>

<p>At noon they stopped for dinner, by which
time they had reached the rapids near Watertown.
Going down David had shot the
rapids without difficulty, no hard task in an
empty canoe, but now it was necessary to
carry, and so when the food had been eaten,
the bundles were lifted from the craft and
they set out by the well-trodden path that
skirted the river. David shared the burdens,
taking for his load a sack of wheat for seeding
and his gun. Isaac shouldered the canoe
and the other two Indians managed the rest.
David, well aware of the Indian weakness
for thievery, watched attentively, and yet,
when the canoe was again loaded above the
rapids, one package was missing. He faced
Isaac sternly.</p>

<p>“There were eight pieces, Isaac,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
“Now there are but seven. Go back and
catchum other piece.”</p>

<p>Isaac looked stupidly about the canoe and
the ground, puffing leisurely on his pipe. At
last: “No seeum,” he said stolidly.</p>

<p>“Go look,” commanded David. Then he
pointed to the others. “You go look too.
Catchum bundle or you catchum licking.”</p>

<p>Isaac shook his head. “Seven pieces,” he
declared. “All there, master.”</p>

<p>“No, there were eight when we started,”
replied the boy firmly. “You find the other
one or you’ll go to jail, Isaac. All three go
to jail. <em>Quog quash!</em> Hurry!”</p>

<p>Isaac looked cunningly from David to the
others, considering. But something in the
boy’s face told him he had best produce the
missing bundle, and with a grunt he turned
back, followed by his companions. Five minutes
later they returned, one of the paddlers
bearing the bundle. No explanation was offered,
nor did David expect any. The package,
containing tobacco and cloth, was
placed in the canoe and the journey began
again. The river was full and the current
swift, especially where the banks were close
together as was frequently the case between
the carry and the lake, and the Indians made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
slow progress. David had to acknowledge to
himself that he would have found that return
trip a hard task, and any lingering resentment
felt toward his uncle disappeared. Had
he been alone it would have taken him a
good half-hour to have moved the goods over
the carry, making no less than six trips,
while the struggle against the current would
doubtless have kept him from reaching home
until well after darkness.</p>

<p>They met but three other voyagers on
their journey and saw no Indians, friendly
or hostile, and just at sunset pulled the canoe
to shore and again shouldered the goods.
David’s father was surprised at sight of the
procession that came out of the woods toward
the house, but, on hearing the boy’s story,
agreed that Master Elkins had ordered
wisely. The Indians were paid off and given
food and tobacco and took themselves away
again, while David, in spite of having done
but little to earn his passage, fell to on his
supper with noble hunger. As he ate—his
father and Obid having already supped—he
told of his meeting with Monapikot and of
the latter’s news, and Master Lindall listened
in all gravity and Obid Dawkin in unconcealed
alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“’Tis as I have told all along,” declared
Obid, his thin voice more than ever like a
rusted wheel in his excitement. “None is
safe in his bed so long as these naked murderers
be allowed to dwell in the same country!
Think you I shall stay here to have my
scalp lifted? I give you notice, Master Lindall,
that so soon as the porridge be cooked
in the morning I take my departure. The
dear Lord knows that ’tis little enough hair
I have left at best, and that little I would
keep, an it please Him! To-morrow morning,
Master Lindall! Say not that I failed
to give you full notice.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet a moment,” replied the master
calmly. “I must think what best to do.
Master Vernham should be acquainted with
this so soon as may be, for if it prove true
that this Wachoosett sachem means mischief
’tis Master Vernham that, being nigher, they
will first assail. Methinks I had best go over
there at once and give him warning. You
will go with me, Obid?”</p>

<p>Nathan Lindall’s eyes twinkled. Obid
turned a dour face toward him. “Not I, in
sooth, master! The forest has no liking for
me since I have heard David’s tale.”</p>

<p>“Then David shall come and you shall remain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
to guard the house. Perhaps that were
better, for should the savages attack while we
be gone you will be more able to cope with
them than the lad.”</p>

<p>Obid’s dismay brought a chuckle from
David. “Whether I go or stay,” he shrilled,
“it seems I must be murdered, then! Nay,
I will accompany you, for at least in the
forest I may have a chance to save myself in
flight, whereas an I bide here I must likely
burn to death like a rabbit in a brush-heap!
But in the morning, master—”</p>

<p>“Twice you have informed me of that,
Obid. Get your hat and gun and let us be
off, magpie. Mayhap if we haste we can
be back before it be fully dark.”</p>

<p>Obid obeyed grumblingly, and soon they
had set forth, leaving David to make fast
the door and windows and await their return.</p>

<p>It would be untrue to say that David felt
no uneasiness, but his uneasiness was not
fear. Besides his own musket and the two
that his father and Obid had taken with
them there was a fourth at hand as well as a
pistol that, although of uncertain accuracy,
could be used if required, and against a few
Indians armed only with bows and arrows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
he felt more than a match. Small openings
at the level of a man’s head, and none so
greatly above the level of David’s, pierced
the four walls and from these at intervals
the boy peered out. The house was set in a
clearing of sufficient area to protect from
sudden attack, and from the nearer forest an
arrow would fall spent before it reached the
dwelling. Even when darkness had settled,
the stars gave enough light to have revealed
to sharp eyes the presence of a skulking figure.
Between watching, David replenished
the fire and dipped into one of two books
that he had brought back with him, but he
was in no mind for settled reading and, when
the better part of two hours had passed,
heard not without relief the sound of his
father’s voice at the edge of the wood.</p>

<p>“Master Vernham had already heard rumors
of mischief against him,” said Nathan
Lindall when he had entered, “and we might
have spared ourselves the journey. He seems
not concerned, but has agreed to observe
caution. He thinks the threats came first
from the Indians we drove away and are but
repeated and adorned as tales ever are. Yet
for my part, David, I am not so easy. ’Tis
a time of unrest, and for a while it will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the part of wisdom to stray not far into the
forest, and never unarmed. What say you,
Obid?”</p>

<p>“I say naught, master. If you choose to
bide here and be done to death, ’tis your own
matter. But as for me, to-morrow morn I
leave!”</p>

<p>“Then ’twere best you fortified yourself
with sleep,” replied Nathan Lindall dryly,
“for the journey is long.”</p>

<p>“Sleep, say you! Not a wink of sleep shall
I have this night. If die I must ’twill be
whilst I’m awake and command all my faculties.”</p>

<p>“Think you, Obid,” asked David slyly,
“that being scalped be the more pleasant for
missing no part of it?”</p>

<p>“Peace, David,” said his father. “’Tis
not seemly to jest on so serious a matter.
Be off to bed, lad.”</p>

<p>Once in the night David awoke and, listening
to the hearty sounds that came from the
farther end of the attic, smiled. “Faith,”
he thought sleepily as he turned over, “if
Obid be still awake he has not the sound
of it!”</p>

<p>Perhaps sleep brought counsel to Obid,
for in the morning there was no more talk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
of leaving; though, for that matter, neither
Nathan Lindall nor David had taken the
servant’s threat seriously. Whatever could
be said of Obid, he was no coward, while,
even if he had been, his devotion to his master
would have proved stronger than his
timidity. That day all three worked hard in
the fields. Although their muskets were
ever within reach, no incident caused any
alarm. And when a second day had likewise
passed uneventfully, even Obid Dawkin
grudgingly allowed that maybe the danger
was not so present as he had feared. But on
the third morning there was another tale to
tell when Obid, opening the door to fetch
water from the well, dropped his pail and fell
back with a groan that brought the others to
his side. Obid, white-faced, pointed to the
stone step outside. There in the first ray of
sunlight lay an arrow wrapped about with
the dried skin of a rattlesnake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<small>DAVID VISITS THE PRAYING VILLAGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“It seems he gives fair warning,” said Nathan
Lindall quietly as he stooped and lifted
the horrid token from the step. The snakeskin
rustled as his hand touched it, and Obid,
peering over his shoulder, shuddered in disgust.
David was already outside, his keen
eyes searching the moist ground. A dozen
steps he took and then pointed toward the
woods to the west.</p>

<p>“Thence he came, sir, and went,” he announced.</p>

<p>“One only?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“Aye, though there may have been more
beyond the clearing.”</p>

<p>“What mean the blue spots on the arrow,
master?” asked Obid troubledly.</p>

<p>Nathan Lindall looked at the three stains
on the slender shaft and shook his head.
“I know not, Obid, unless they be this sachem’s
signature. Or mayhap they have a
more trenchant meaning. What matter? He
has put us on our guard, though for what
reason I cannot discern.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Then can I, master,” said Obid bitterly.
“Murder be enough for the bloody-minded
savage, but he must even forewarn us that
we may suffer first in anticipation of our
fate.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said David. “’Tis the Indian
way to give challenge, and by so doing fight
fairly, Obid. When all is said, father, he has
done us a kindness, for now we know of a
certainty that he means us harm and we can
be more than ever on our guard.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a childish play,” said Nathan Lindall,
“and none but a child would be disturbed
thereby.” He made as if to break the
arrow in his hands, but David spoke quickly.</p>

<p>“Let me have it, father. ’Tis like none
other I have seen and I would keep it.”</p>

<p>“A pretty keepsake, indeed,” muttered
Obid, as he went back to his tasks. “Have
no fear but that they be waiting to give us
plenty more of its like!”</p>

<p>The incident could not fail to cast a shade
of gloom over the morning meal, and all
three were more silent than usual. Soon
after they had finished, there came a hail
from the front and Master William Vernham
and a servant approached. Their neighbor
was a tall, grim-faced man of upwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
of fifty, long of leg and arm, clean-shaven
save for the veriest wisp of grizzled hair upon
his lip. He bore with him another such arrow
as Obid had stumbled upon and was in
a fine temper over it.</p>

<p>“On my very doorsill ’twas lain, Master
Lindall! Did ever one know of such insolence?
What, pray, is the Colony come to
when these red devils be allowed to come and
go at will, indulging themselves in all manner
of mischief and seeking to frighten honest
folk with such clownish tricks? Governor
Leverett shall know of this ere night, and
if he fail to dispatch militia to clear the country
hereabouts of the varmints, then I shall
call on you, Nathan Lindall, and all others
within reach to aid me in the task, for patience
is no longer a virtue.”</p>

<p>“The task will be no easy one,” answered
Master Lindall, “for these Indians are but
a handful and seeking for them will be like
seeking a needle in a haymow. But you may
count on me to aid, Master Vernham. As for
asking help of the Governor, I fear ’twill be
but a waste of time, for we be too far from
the towns to cause him concern. ’Twill be
best to take the law into our own hands, as
you have said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, that be true. What disposition,
think you, will be made of that Nausauwah
that we took prisoner to Boston?”</p>

<p>“I know not. Perchance ’twere best for
our heads were he set free with a fine, since,
from what I make of it, this Metipom’s quarrel
with us is on his account.”</p>

<p>William Vernham shook his head stoutly.
“Nay, that were truckling with the villains.
Rather shall I beg the Governor to hang the
wastrel on Gallows Hill as soon as may be.
’Tis not fair dealing that the savages require,
but harshness. They construe justice to be
weakness in their heathen ignorance.” He
continued in like vein, so finally working off
his anger. Then: “What think you of this,
Neighbor Lindall?” he asked at length.
“Will these skulking devils try to burn our
houses about our heads or pick us off the
while we toil in the fields?”</p>

<p>“Perchance no more will come of it,”
was the answer. “As I understand the sachem’s
meaning, he bids us release his son
or else our lives will be forfeit. Having sent
his message he must wait a time for our
answer. An he wait long enough his petty
quarrel will be as but a flea-bite in the greater
trouble that will be upon us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“You still look for a rising? Tush, tush,
Master Lindall; I tell you this King Philip,
as they call him, has not the courage. He but
brags in his cups. Nay, nay, such annoyances
as this we shall have to put up with
until the country be cleaned of the vermin,
but as for another such war as was fought
with the Pequots, why, that cannot be. Well,
I must be off. To-morrow you shall hear
from me so soon as I return from Boston.”</p>

<p>“I would I were as certain as he,” murmured
Nathan Lindall as the visitors departed.</p>

<p>Three days later, the Governor having dispatched
one Sergeant Major Whipple to take
command of the settlers, some sixteen of the
latter met at Master Vernham’s, well armed,
and made diligent search for many miles
about, finding numerous wandering Indians
to whom no blame could be laid, but failing
to apprehend or even discover trace of any
hostile savages. So for the time ended the
incident of the spotted arrows, and the memory
of it dimmed, and while Nathan Lindall
and William Vernham and their households
were careful to go well armed about their
duties, and a watch was kept throughout the
nights, yet after a fortnight vigilance waned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and even Obid was found by David fast
asleep one night when he should have been
awake and watchful. By this time June had
come in hot and the corn was planted in the
south field, and the kitchen garden was
already showing the green sprouts of carrots
and parsnips and turnips and other vegetables
which grew, it seemed, fully as well as
in England. Then, on a day when there was
a lapse of work for him to do, David set
forth for Natick to see Monapikot again,
since, in spite of the Pegan’s promise to come
within the week, David had seen naught of
him. By river the distance to the village of
the Praying Indians was nearly twenty miles,
so devious was the stream’s winding course,
whereas on foot it was but a matter of four
or five. And yet David might well hesitate
in the choice of routes, for by land the way
led through the Long Marsh, which would
have been more appropriately called bog, and
save for what runways the deer had made
therein there was no sort of trail. It was the
thought of having to remain at the village
overnight that finally decided David to take
the land route, and he set out early one
morning with musket across his shoulder
and bread and meat in his pouch, and in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
ears his father’s injunction to be watchful.</p>

<p>His way led him along the brook that
flowed into the clearing, for it was by following
that stream that he would unfailingly
reach the first of the two large ponds lying
between him and the Indian village. Now
and then, after he had passed into the forest,
he was able to walk briskly, but for the most
part he had to make his own path, since for
the last year or two the woods had not been
fired thereabouts by the Indians and the underbrush
had grown up rankly. Presently a
small pond barred his way and he was some
time finding the brook again. The most of
two hours had gone before the first of the
two large ponds lay before him. It was a full
half-mile long and lay in a veritable quagmire
over which David had to make his way
with caution lest he step between the knolls
or the uncertain hummocks of grass and sink
to his middle, which had happened to him
before. Many water birds swam upon the
pond, and had he been minded to add game
to his bag he might easily have done so.
Mosquitoes attacked him ravenously, for
the country was low-lying and no breeze dispelled
the sultry stillness of the morning,
and, when laden with a gun and balancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
one’s self on a swaying tuft of grass, fighting
the vicious insects was no graceful task!
Alders and swamp willows barred his path
and creeping vines sought to trip him, and it
was not long before he was in a fine condition
of perspiration—and exasperation as
well.</p>

<p>At length a well-defined trail came to his
rescue and led him around the end of the
first pond and above the head of the second,
although he had to ford a shallow, muddy
stream on the way. More marsh followed
and then the ground grew higher and pines
and hemlocks and big-girthed oaks took the
place of the switches. This second pond was
a handsome expanse, lying blue and unruffled
under the June sky with the reflection of
white, fluffy clouds mirrored therein. As he
neared the southern extremity of it, where it
ended in a small cove, his eyes fell on a
canoe formed of a hollowed pine trunk from
which two squaws were fishing. The Indian
women viewed him incuriously as he passed
amongst the trees. They were, as he knew,
dwellers in Master Eliot’s village, now but a
scant mile distant. Even as he watched,
there was a splashing of the still surface beside
the dugout and a fine bass leaped into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the sunlight. David paused and watched
with a tingle of his pulse while the squaw
who had hooked the fish cautiously drew him
nearer the side of the canoe. The bass fought
gamely, again and again flopping well out of
the pond in the effort to shake free of the
hook that held him, but his struggles were
vain, and presently a short spear of sharpened
wood was thrust from the canoe and a
naked brown arm swept upward and the bass
sparkled for an instant in the sunlight ere he
disappeared in the bottom of the craft. No
sign of pride or satisfaction disturbed the
countenance of the Indian woman. She bent
for a moment and then straightened and
her newly baited hook again dropped quietly
into the water.</p>

<p>“Had I brought such a monster to land,”
reflected David, “I should be now singing
for joy!”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1675 the Natick Indian
village was a well-ordered community. It
lay upon both banks of the Charles River,
with an arched footbridge laid upon strong
stone piers between. Several wide streets
were laid out upon which the dwellings faced
and each family had its own allotted ground
for garden and pasture. Save for the meeting-house,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
a story-and-a-half erection of
rough-hewn timbers enclosed in a palisaded
fort, wooden buildings were scarce, since the
Indians clung to their own style of dwelling.
Some half-hundred wigwams composed the
village, although not all were then occupied.
There were many neat gardens, and fruit-trees
abounded. Altogether the village looked
prosperous and contented as David came
toward it that June morning. The streets
were given over chiefly to the children, it
seemed, and these used them as playgrounds.
At the door of a wigwam a squaw sat here
and there at some labor, but industry was
not a notable feature of the village. Save
that a dog barked at him, David’s arrival
went unchallenged, and he crossed the long
footbridge and sought the palisade where he
thought to find Pikot at his duties of teaching
the younger men and women. A lodge
rather more pretentious than the rest was the
residence of the sachem Waban, a Nipmuck
who had lived previously at Nonantum and
who had become the most prominent of Master
Eliot’s disciples and, it is thought, the
most earnest. Waban had married a daughter
of the famous Tahattawan, sachem of
the country about the Concord River, himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
a convert to Christianity and a teacher
of it amongst his people. Besides being sachem,
Waban likewise held the office of justice
of the peace, and it was he who had a few
years before written the laconic warrant for
the arrest of an offender named Jeremiah
Offscow: “To you big constable, quick you
catch um, strong you hold um, safe you bring
um afore me, Waban, justice peace.” David
knew the sachem well and meant to visit
him before he left, but now he kept on to the
meeting-house wherein the school was held
on week-days and where the Reverend John
Eliot discoursed to the Indians, and, usually,
to a few English besides, on the Sabbath. The
preacher lived when at the village in a small
chamber divided off from the attic above.</p>

<p>David found Pikot busy with another
teacher inside the building, and seated himself
within the door to wait. Some fourteen
or fifteen pupils, the younger members of the
community, were at their lessons, and David
had perforce to own that they indeed behaved
with more decorum than a like number
of English would have. Now and then a
sly glance of curiosity came David’s way
from a pair of dark eyes, but for the most
part his presence went unheeded. The Indians’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
voices sounded flat and expressionless
as they answered the questions put to them
or recited in unison a portion of the lesson.
Indeed, David much questioned that they
fully understood what they said save as a
parrot might! After a while the class was
dismissed and went sedately forth, boys and
girls alike, and Pikot joined David and led
him out of the building and through the palisade
gate and so to the river where, on a
flat stone above the stream, they sat themselves
and began their talk.</p>

<p>“You came not for the fishing, Straight
Arrow,” charged David. “To an Indian who
does not keep his word I have naught to
say.”</p>

<p>Pikot smiled. “True, Noawama, yet
’twas not of choice that I failed you. I went
a long journey that took many days and I
could not send you word.”</p>

<p>“A long journey?” asked David eagerly.
“Whither did you go?”</p>

<p>The Indian’s expression became strangely
blank as he waved his hand vaguely westward.
“Toward the Great River, David.”</p>

<p>“That they call the Connecticote? Tell
me of your journey, Pikot. What did you
go for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“The business was not mine, brother, and
I may not talk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, have your secrets then. And
I’ll have mine.”</p>

<p>Monapikot smiled faintly. “And if I
guess them?”</p>

<p>“I give you leave, O Brother of the Owl,”
jeered David.</p>

<p>The Indian half closed his eyes and peered
at the tops of the tall pines that crowned the
hill. “Came one by night through the forest,”
he said slowly in his native tongue.
“The skin of a panther hung about him and
he was armed only with a knife. As the
weasel creeps through the grass, so this one
crept to the lodge of the white man where all
were asleep. On the stone without the door
he laid a message from his sachem. As the
fox slinks homeward when the sun arises,
so this one slunk away. The forest took him
and he vanished.”</p>

<p>“How know you that?” asked David,
affecting great surprise. “It but happened
half a moon ago and none has heard of it
save all the world! Can it be that you know
also what the message was like?”</p>

<p>“An arrow wrapped with the cast skin of
a rattlesnake, brother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“Wonderful! And it may be that you can
tell how the arrow was made, O Great Powwow.”</p>

<p>“’Twas headed with an eagle’s claw and
tipped with gray feathers. Three blue marks
were on it, O Noawama.”</p>

<p>David frowned. “Now as to that I wonder,”
he said. “None saw the arrow save
we three. How then could you know that the
head was not of stone or the horn of the
deer?”</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you I could guess your
secret?”</p>

<p>“Aye, but methinks you are not guessing,
Pikot. And how know you that the messenger
came unarmed and wearing a panther-skin?”</p>

<p>“How know you that I speak true?” asked
Pikot, smiling.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied David ruefully,
“but I would almost take oath to it.
Saw you this Wachoosett, Pikot?”</p>

<p>Pikot shook his head. “Nay.”</p>

<p>“Then how—”</p>

<p>“The Wachoosetts be fond of panther-skins,
David, and the braves wear them
much, as I know. As for the knife, an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
has no use for bow and arrow at night, nor,
on a long journey, does he weight himself
with a tomahawk. The eagle nests in the
great hill in the Wachoosett country and
Wachoosett people arm their arrows with the
eagle’s claws, and tip them with feathers
from the eagle’s wing. As for the blue spots,
that I heard, brother.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” But David viewed Pikot doubtfully.
“I still think you knew more than
you guessed. But ’tis no matter. This Metipom
troubles us no more. Doubtless he
waits to find whether his son be judged
guilty or no. How far is this country of the
Wachoosetts, Straight Arrow?”</p>

<p>“Maybe twelve leagues.”</p>

<p>“No farther than that? ’Tis but a half-day
journey for an Indian, then.”</p>

<p>“Nay, for there be many streams and
hills. One travels not as an eagle flies,
brother.”</p>

<p>“True, and still this Metipom lives too
near for my liking. Think you he still means
mischief, Pikot?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” answered the Pegan gravely.
“But it may be, as you say, that he will wait
and see how his son fares in the court in Boston.
You do ill to travel alone through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
forest, David, and when you return I will go
with you.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad of your company, but I
have no fear.”</p>

<p>“Nor had the lion, and yet the wolves
ate him.” Pikot glanced at the sun and
arose. “Come and eat meat with me, David,
and then we will start the journey back, for
I would have you safe before the shadows
are long.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<small>WHAT HAPPENED AT THE POOL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The sun was still above the hills when Pikot
bade farewell to David beyond the little pond
that lay somewhat more than a mile from his
home. The Indian would have gone farther,
but David protested against it.</p>

<p>When David reached the house, he learned
the news that had come that day from Boston
by travelers who had stopped on their
way to Dedham. Two days before Poggapanossoo,
otherwise known as Tobias, and
Mattashinnamy had been hanged at Plymouth.
These were two of the three Indians
who had been convicted of killing Sassamon
the year before, and Tobias was one
of King Philip’s counselors. The third Indian
under sentence had, it seemed, been
reprieved, though the Dedham men did not
know for what cause. David’s father took a
gloomy view of the affair.</p>

<p>“’Twere better had they let them lie in
jail for a while longer,” he said, “for their
execution is likely to prove the last straw to
Philip, who has long been seeking a nail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
upon which to hang a quarrel. I fear the
skies will soon be red again, David. I like
it not.”</p>

<p>“But these Indians were fairly tried,
father, and surely they merited their punishment.”</p>

<p>“Aye, lad, but there could have been no
harm in delay.”</p>

<p>“But if, as you have said, a strong hand
should be shown? Will not King Philip,
mayhap, take warning by the fate of these
murderers?”</p>

<p>“Wisely said,” piped Obid, busy at the
hearth with the preparation of the evening
meal. “An those of the Plymouth Colony,
as well as we, were but to choose every other
savage and hang him, ’twould put a quick
end to these troubles. And I would that this
Preacher Eliot were here to hearken.”</p>

<p>“Time alone will tell,” said Nathan Lindall
soberly. “Yet the men from Dedham
were not so minded. They foresee war with
King Philip and dread that he will persuade
the Narragansett Indians to join with him.
‘When the leaves are on the trees,’ said Tanopet.”</p>

<p>“We here are far distant from Philip,
though,” said David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>“Little profit there will be in that,” said
Obid dourly, “with fivescore savages but
five miles distant and the country full of
wandering marauders! For my part, I tell
you, ’twill be a relief to me when my scalp
be well dangling from an Indian belt and I
have no longer to worry about the matter.”</p>

<p>“Waban, at Natick, is a firm friend of
the English,” replied David stoutly. “There
is naught to fear from there. Nor do I believe
that any Nipmuck will take arms
against us. Indeed, an I am to see fighting,
I must, methinks, move up the river to Dedham
or join the Plymouth men.”</p>

<p>“Do not jest, David,” counseled his
father. “It may be that you will find more
fighting than will suit your stomach.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” answered the boy gayly,
“here is what suits my stomach very well.
’Twould be a monstrous pity to scalp you,
Obid, so long as you can make such stew as
this!”</p>

<p>A week went by, during which the corn
sprouted finely, coaxed upward by gentle
rains that came at night and vanished with
the sun. There was plenty of work in field
and garden and David had scant time for
play. Yet he found opportunity to fish in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the river in the long evenings, paddling up to
the falls and dropping his line in the deep,
black pools there. He had brought some
English hooks back with him from Boston
and liked them well. No more news came
from the outer world save that at Boston
there was much uneasiness of an uprising of
the Indians and drilling of the militia each
day. If Philip meant mischief he bided his
time.</p>

<p>The days grew very hot and the river
dwindled in its bed. The brook through the
clearing was no more than a trickle, for the
spring had been unusually dry and the little
showers no more than dampened the soil.
One night David awoke in the darkness with
the sound of great thunder in his ears and
saw the window flash glaring white with the
lightning. But the storm passed them by,
rumbling off at last into the north, leaving
the ground as parched as before. The kitchen
garden must be watered by hand, and, lest
the well go dry, David carried water in
buckets from the small pool that lay in the
swamp to the west, stumbling so frequently
on his way back that the pails were seldom
more than half-filled when he arrived. William
Vernham came one day past the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of June and took dinner with them, being
full of a project to build a road between Nathan
Lindall’s house and his own over which
one might travel by horseback. David’s
father, however, was faint-hearted in the
matter, since the distance was all of three
miles and much swampy ground intervened.
Besides which, as David, listening to the
talk, thought, but did not say, Master Lindall
owned no horse. In the end the visitor
went away again somewhat disgruntled.</p>

<p>So passed the first of the summer very
peacefully until July had come in. Then one
day messengers came up the river from Newtowne
with the news so long dreaded. King
Philip had at last thrown down the gauntlet.
The day before an express had reached Boston
from the Plymouth Colony bearing a
letter from Governor Winslow announcing
that an attack had occurred on the settlement
at Swansea and that several of the
English had been killed. Philip, it was said,
had already armed more than a thousand
of his people and from now on it was war to
the knife. Messengers were on their way to
the Narragansetts to persuade them not to
join forces with Philip and Governor Leverett
had offered Governor Winslow aid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
arms and ammunition. Meanwhile the train-bands
were preparing in case of need.</p>

<p>To David the tidings were not wholly
amiss, for the prospect of bearing arms and
fighting against King Philip’s Indians was
enough to make any boy’s heart beat faster.
Nathan Lindall seemed in better spirits for
the news and even Obid was more cheerful
now that the die was cast. That night they
sat long about the fire and cleaned the guns
with oil and fine ashes and discussed the
matter well. It was southward that the first
trouble would come, they agreed, and so Nathan
Lindall laid plans to remove his cattle
to Natick so soon as necessity was shown
and join the men of Dedham. Sleep did not
come readily to David that night, and Obid’s
snores long made an accompaniment to the
visions of marches and bloody battles that
visited him in the darkness. And yet when
the new day came life was disappointingly
much as before. There was corn to hoe and
weeds to be pulled and the sun was hotter
than ever and martial glory seemed as far
away as ever.</p>

<p>But the frontier was stirring and men
came and went by land and river, and seldom
a day passed that red man or white did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
not pause at the plantation to exchange news
and opinions. Of these was Joe Tanopet, resplendent
in a ruffled shirt of which he
seemed very proud, and which, David suspected,
would come to pieces were the Indian
to try to remove it. In spite of the heat
Tanopet wore his green waistcoat, for association
with the English had convinced him
that discomfort and respectability were inseparable.
He had no news of importance, or
professed to have none, and said that he had
spent the month fishing in the Long Pond
beyond Natick. As proof of the assertion he
brought eight fat bass, which Obid subsequently
threw to the hogs, since, as he said,
they had been overlong from their native
element.</p>

<p>Word came from Boston that Daniel
Henchman, the schoolmaster, had been chosen
by the Council to be Captain of Infantry
and that able soldiers to the number of one
hundred were shortly to march under him
toward the south; and also that a company
of horse was forming under Captain Prentice.
Nathan Lindall went up to Dedham
one morning and returned late that night
with the tidings that the troops had left Boston
the day before, and that with them had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
gone Samuel Mosely and more than a hundred
volunteers gathered together in Boston
in, it was said, less than three hours’ time.</p>

<p>“Had I been in Boston I would have
joined, too,” said David regretfully.</p>

<p>“This Mosely is he who was wont to be a
pirate at Jamaica, I take it,” said Obid. “I
doubt a fitter man could be found to deal
with the savages, master.”</p>

<p>“Nay, a privateer he was, Obid, with the
King’s commission.”</p>

<p>“I see but little difference,” Obid grumbled.
“Nor matters it so long as he employs
a pirate’s methods against the heathen.”</p>

<p>News came slowly, but about the first of
the month they learned that Swansea had
been burned to the ground by the Indians
and that the English troops had made rendezvous
there and had moved against the
hostiles who were in force near by. David
pleaded with his father to be allowed to go to
Dedham and join a band then being recruited,
but was denied. Stories of unrest among
the Nipmucks trickled in, and from Boston
came the report that the Indians of the several
Praying Villages were under suspicion
and that a plan that had been advanced
to recruit them into the English forces was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
loudly declaimed against. William Vernham
came over with the first authentic account
of the Swansea attack, which, it seemed, had
begun with the plundering of one or two
houses by a force of six or eight of Philip’s
men from Mount Hope. Aid was summoned
from Plymouth and an attack by the Indians
in force was prevented by the assembling
of some forty of the English at the
Swansea bridge. The Indians retreated
again to Mount Hope, but subsequently
preyed on the settlement in small bands,
killing eight persons and cutting off their
feet and hands as well as scalping them.
They also fired at least one house. The inhabitants
were forced to abandon the town,
removing themselves and their household
goods and live-stock to Rehoboth and there
fortifying themselves in three dwellings. The
Indians then burned Swansea to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Both the Narragansetts and Nipmucks
have joined with King Philip,” added Master
Vernham, “though both had promised
to take no sides in the matter. ’Twill not be
long, I doubt, ere the war-cries ring in our
ears even here, for, an I mistake not, Philip
has laid his plans well and ere the summer be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
gone we shall see all the tribes hereabouts
arrayed against us. I would there were the
means at hand to construct a stockade fort,
but ’tis a task too great for a few hands. We
shall have to retire either to Newtowne or
Dedham, Master Lindall.”</p>

<p>“I shall remove what I may to Natick,”
replied Nathan Lindall, “and join the militia
so soon as ’tis seen that the Indians mean
to carry the war into this country. There
be three of us here, Master Vernham, who
can shoot fairly straight and, though men of
peace, are ready to avenge those so foully
murdered at Swansea.”</p>

<p>“Were it not for Mistress Vernham I
would bid you say four,” said the other
gloomily. “Nay, even so, an the varmints
come hither, I will join you.”</p>

<p>When the visitor had gone again, David
set about the watering of the garden, for the
rain still held away and the crops were
drooping sadly. There were those who connected
the unnatural drouth with the eclipse
of the moon that had happened a week or so
before and who predicted all kinds of dire
things in consequence. The small pond in
the marsh still held a little muddy water,
although it was fast drying up, and to reach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
it David had built a sort of pier of stones
over the mire. To-day he had filled one
bucket and carried it to the bank and was
filling the second when a slight sound in the
alders to the left caused him to glance
swiftly. That something had moved there
he was certain, and it seemed that his eyes
had glimpsed it, and yet it was gone before
he could be sure of the latter. He had an impression
of something brown or leather-hued
between the trees which might well have been
an old fox. He listened intently and searched
the thicket with his gaze, but no other sound
reached him, and presently he lifted the
bucket and picked his way across the stones
to the firm ground. There the sensation of
being watched came to him strongly, so that
the skin at the back of his neck prickled, and
he wheeled quickly and again scanned the
swamp. A bird fluttering amongst the alders
caused his heart to jump and he laughed at
himself and took up his buckets.</p>

<p>“’Tis this talk of Indians,” he muttered
as he made his way along the path he had
worn to the clearing. “I am as fluttery as a
hen!”</p>

<p>He was a scant three paces from the edge
of the thicket when the noise of a snapping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
twig brought him up short. Ten yards away
to the right a half-naked Indian stepped
toward him. As David turned, the savage’s
hand went up in friendly gesture.</p>

<p>“Noicantop?” he called, the Nipmuck
equivalent for “How do you?”</p>

<p>“Dock tau he?” (“Who are you?”) returned
David sternly.</p>

<p>“Netop.” (“A friend.”)</p>

<p>“Speak English, friend. What you
want?”</p>

<p>“Me got um message speak you David
man.” The Indian made his way toward David
unhurriedly. He was a tall, slim youth of
twenty-two or -three, naked to the waist, unarmed
save for a hunting-knife at his belt.
His scalp-lock was confined in a metal tube
some three inches in length above which it
was gathered in a black knot and adorned
with several long feathers of yellow and red.
Three strings of black-and-white wampum
were about his neck and his girdle was
elaborately worked with colored porcupine
quills. That he was not one of the Natick
tribe was evident, for they no longer painted
their bodies whereas this youth showed
many smears of yellow, red, and brown on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
face and chest. Doubtful, David raised a
hand.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he said. “Who sends this message?”</p>

<p>The Indian paused and his gaze, leaving
David, shot for an instant past the boy’s
head. <a href="#i_fp080">In that instant David knew, and his
heart leaped into his throat.</a> He loosed his
hands and the buckets fell to the ground, but
ere he could turn, the foe was upon him.
Strong arms twined about him and he was
borne backward in a welter of snapping
branches and came to earth with the breath
jarred from his body.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>CAPTURED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There had been no time to cry out, so
quickly had he been overcome, and now the
opportunity was past. A twisted cloth was
thrust into his mouth and tied behind his
head ere he could bring his astonished muscles
to obey him. Then, although he heaved
and fought, his efforts were vain. Three
snarling, painted faces bent over him, a
knife poised itself above his heart, and in
a trice his arms were pinioned securely.
Surprise had given place to wrath, and David
panted and mouthed and kicked, glaring
back at his captors madly. He was angry
with himself as well as with them, mortified
to think that he should have so easily fallen
into their trap. Tears threatened his eyes
and he had difficulty keeping them back.
When they had him secure, leaving, however,
his feet free, they lifted him up, and
the one who had greeted him from the
thicket spoke.</p>

<p>“You come, we no hurt. You no come,
we kill.” He pressed the point of his knife<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
gently against David’s throat. If he thought
to see the lad flinch, he was mistaken. David
moved no muscle. Only his eyes shot
venom into the face of the savage. The Indian
grunted and stepped back. “Good,”
he said. “You come, no make kill.” One
of the others had gone back into the swamp
and now returned with a musket, two bows,
and two quivers of gray-tipped arrows. The
arrows settled for David the identity of his
captors. They were, he reasoned, Wachoosett
Indians, emissaries of the sachem Woosonametipom.
What they meant to do with
him he could not yet fathom. Handing the
musket to the English-speaking Indian, the
one who had fetched it turned his attention
to the buckets and the three discussed them
for a moment. David made out only an occasional
word, for, while the language they
used was undoubtedly Nipmuck, their guttural
speech was different from the clear
articulation and careful phrasing of Monapikot.
Finally it was decided to take one of
the buckets and leave the other, and the one
who had proposed it, who seemed the oldest
of the three, secured it with a rawhide thong
to his girdle. As the bucket was made of
oak with iron hoops and bail, it was no light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
burden. But its gratified possessor seemed
not to mind its weight and even looked back
regretfully at its companion left behind.</p>

<p>It was he who led the way. David went
next, and at the rear came the Indian with
the musket. For more than a mile they kept
to the swamp land and woods, following first
the dried bed of a runnel and later the foot
of a long hill whose wooded summit stood
dark against the yellow of the western sky.
No word was spoken and scarcely a twig was
snapped or a branch flicked by the savages.
Had David’s plight been less unhappy, he
might have enjoyed seeing with what ease
and in what stealthy silence the leader made
his cautious way through the underbrush.
Branches parted and swept together again
without a sound, and even the bucket swinging
at his hip never once caught. The pace
was not fast, but it never faltered, and to
David, who had not the use of his arms to
aid him, it was more rapid than he would
have chosen. Once, catching a foot in a vine,
he fell headlong, with much noise, unable
to save himself, and was jerked rudely to his
feet again by the Indian behind him, who
growled at him in Nipmuck words he did not
understand, but whose tenor was clear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
enough. Twilight settled and the forest became
full of shadows. By this time, however,
they had left the lowlands and were
proceeding generally northwestward through
open woods. David’s captors did not appear
to be apprehensive of meeting any one, although
it was evident that they wanted to
get their prey well out of that part of the
country before pursuit might be started. So
far as the boy knew there lay no settlement
for many miles in the direction they were
taking, since the little village at Sudbury lay
well to the west and the Concord settlement
more to the east. For that matter, he reflected
hopelessly, they might easily pass
within a stone-throw of either place in the
darkness without danger of being seen.</p>

<p>When an hour or more had passed, the
woods ended and, in the starlit darkness, a
broad meadow stretched for miles. Here and
there lay the glimmer of water, and David
knew that they had come to the edge of the
Sudbury Marshes through which wound the
Crooked River. A halt was called, and David’s
gag was removed that he might eat the
cracked raw corn that they fed him. At first
his jaws were too stiff to move and his lips
and tongue were numb, but presently he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
able to chew the food and swallow it. No fire
was lighted, and, when they had rested for a
half-hour, they went on again. By thrusting
his jaw out, David succeeded in having the
gag replaced more loosely, although it still
effectually prevented him from making any
outcry. Across the meadow they went to the
river, and there without hesitation they descended
into the water and, since the stream
was low, forded without being wet above
their middles. Again they found woodland,
and unerringly the elder of the three entered
it and went on at his unfaltering pace. David
kept close at his heels. The short halt
had rested him, but walking with the hands
tied behind one is difficult, and soon he began
to lag. That was the signal for an ungentle
prod from the Indian behind him and
David increased his pace again. All sorts of
plans for escape came to him only to be dismissed
as impractical. Had he had the use
of his hands, he might have attempted stepping
aside and trusting to elude his captors
in the blackness of the forest, but to try that
under the conditions was useless. He would
have blundered into trees and doubtless
fallen before he had gone a dozen steps.</p>

<p>From the evenness of the path they trod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
he judged that they were on one of the main
Indian trails leading from the coast inland.
These were well-trod paths over which one
might easily ride on horseback, as the settlers
had discovered. But they were far from
level as often leading over a hill as around it,
and the boy’s body was presently sore and
his lungs hot and dry. He thought they must
have covered a good twelve miles, and was
convinced that he could go but a little way
farther. The proddings at his back came frequently
now, and he was bidden “quog
quosh!” or “more fast!” But even threats
failed at last and David stumbled and sank
to the ground and closed his eyes deliciously.
Again they raised him, the one in command
striking him harshly with the butt of his
musket. David felt the blow, but was dead
to the pain of it and toppled again to earth
the instant they released him.</p>

<p>“You no sleep! You make hurry more
fast. No can lie down. You walk-walk or
me kill!”</p>

<p>“Matta,” muttered David. “Naut
seam.” (“No, very tired.”)</p>

<p>“You want kill?” demanded the Indian
angrily. “You want be dead, stay here all-time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>David heard, but was too sleepy to answer.
Something sharp pierced his doublet,
under a shoulder, and he groaned. Again he
was pulled to his feet and again they refused
to bear him. After that he was only dimly
aware of what went on, for his eyes would
not stay open and sleep was ever just behind
them. He heard his captors talking, although
their voices seemed to come from a
great distance. Then the voices dwindled
and silence fell. David slept.</p>

<p>An hour later they waked him and pulled
him to his feet. Still dazed with sleep, he
remonstrated fretfully, and would not stand
until again that sharp sting of a knife-point
made him wince and come back to reality.</p>

<p>The Indian who spoke English was talking
to him. “You plenty sleep, David man.
You walk-walk. You no walk-walk we stick
um knife very good!”</p>

<p>“Aye, I’ll walk. I’m rested now. What
name you?”</p>

<p>“Sequanawah,” replied the Indian after a
moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“You Wachoosett man?”</p>

<p>“You no talk. You make hurry,” was the
gruff answer. “Quog quosh.”</p>

<p>On they went through the dark forest, now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
and then climbing across some bare hill-top
where the starlight showed David the form
of the Indian ahead and from where he could
vaguely sense the wooded valleys below them.
The cooler air of early morning blew in their
faces at such times, bringing a shiver even
as it refreshed. For some reason, probably
because there was no longer any necessity,
they had not replaced the gag in the boy’s
mouth, and he was able to breathe freely and
even to talk, although talking was quickly
discouraged. Just before dawn another halt
was made and the Indians again produced
corn from their pouches and gave David a
handful of it to munch. Only once had he
had water, and now he was thirsty again
and said so.</p>

<p>Sequanawah grunted. “You come,” he
said.</p>

<p>David followed to where, some forty yards
away from their resting-place, the Indian
stooped in the half-darkness and scraped at
the leaves under a giant birch. Then he
leaned his head down to the basin he had
formed and David heard him drink. When
the boy had also had his fill of the cool but
brackish water, he followed the Indian back,
and on the way he asked wonderingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“How you know water there, Sequanawah?”</p>

<p>“Me smell um,” was the grave reply.</p>

<p>As David couldn’t see the Indian’s face,
he was unable to say whether the latter was
in earnest or not, and the matter ever remained
a mystery to him. Sitting again, Sequanawah
emptied a tiny bit of powder onto
a flat stone, laid a few wisps of birch bark
above it, and set fire with the flint of his
musket. Then a half-dozen twigs were
placed on the little blaze and the Indians
carefully filled their pipes with tobacco and
lighted them. After that there was no word
uttered until the weed was smoked.</p>

<p>Then Sequanawah grunted: “Hub!” and
the others arose.</p>

<p>“How much more walk?” asked David.</p>

<p>Sequanawah looked around at the clustering
trees and up at the sky that now
showed gray above them. “Pausochu,” he
answered. (“A little way.”)</p>

<p>What was to happen to him when the journey
was ended, David did not know, but he
was weary through and through and almost
any fate seemed preferable to further toiling
up and down hills. He no longer doubted
that his destination was the village of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Wachoosett Indians near the Lone Hill,
which, he had gathered from Monapikot, was
a very tall mountain standing quite by itself
far from any English settlement. Whether
Woosonametipom meant to kill him or put
him to torture or merely hold him prisoner,
time alone could reveal.</p>

<p>After another hour’s progress, they
emerged from the forest in a meadow that
lay about a fair-sized pond. The dawn was
close at hand and near-by objects were
plainly discernible. Sequanawah pointed a
naked arm, and David, following with his
gaze, made out dimly in the grayness a great
hill that loomed before them less than a mile
distant.</p>

<p>“Great Sachem Woosonametipom him
live,” said the Indian. “Quog quosh!”</p>

<p>So forward they went, skirting the pond
wherein the frogs were already talking to
each other in deep voices, and came presently
to more woods. The ground began to
rise and somewhere ahead a dog barked.
Others answered. They were on a well-trodden
trail that wound upward through
oaks and maples and tall, slim pines. Suddenly
a clearing was before them, a wide
plateau near the foot of the mountain. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
wigwams showed their tops above a rude
palisade of logs and the smoke of early fires
filled the air. The barking of dogs made a
great din, and, as David’s captors paused at
the edge of the woods, a door in the fort
opened and several Indians, men and women,
came through, and with them a dozen
snarling, barking mongrels, and Sequanawah
called something above the clamor and they
went forward again toward the doorway.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>METIPOM QUESTIONS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The wigwam was so large that forty men
might have sat within it, but when David,
thrust through the opening by Sequanawah,
entered, it was comparatively empty. A man,
a woman, three young children, and a few
dogs squatted or lay about the fire in the
center. The man was smoking a long pipe,
the squaw was preparing breakfast. The
smoke from the small fire mingled with that
of the sachem’s pipe and filled the dwelling
with acrid fumes that made the boy’s eyes
blink and smart. The dogs arose, growling,
and crept forward to sniff at his heels, while
the sachem only nodded without taking his
pipe from his mouth and the squaw looked
up stolidly from her task. Sequanawah spoke
and the sachem answered a dozen words.
Sequanawah stepped to the doorway and
called. The call was taken up without. Silence
fell in the wigwam save for the sizzling
of the none too dry fagots and the suspicious
whining of the dogs, which, finding nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
to tempt them in the heavy leather of the
captive’s shoes, retreated to the fire. The
children, the youngest scarcely more than a
papoose, gazed with steady, curious, dark
eyes. Only the largest, who might have been
six years of age, boasted clothing of any
sort, and his costume was no more than a
cloth about his middle. He was already well
bronzed of skin, but the youngest child was
still nearly as white as when born.</p>

<p>While he stood there awaiting what Fate
should award him, David viewed the sachem
of the Wachoosetts with interest. The chief
was an older man than he had thought; perhaps
well-nigh sixty; and his hair was
streaked with gray. But he was still straight
of back and firm of body, and the years
seemed to have dealt lightly with him. He
was a large man, broad of shoulder and deep
of chest, and his muscles looked strong and
hard. In countenance he was well-favored
for one of his tribe, for the Nipmucks, unlike
some of the more northerly tribes, were
generally unprepossessing of form and feature.
Woosonametipom had a long head and
sharp cheek-bones, the latter more prominent
because of the thinness of the face, and
the lines and wrinkles were many and deep.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
The eyes were bright, however, and, although
the sachem’s countenance expressed harshness
and cruelty, David found nothing
therein suggesting meanness. He wore clothing
befitting his rank: a cloak of panther-skin
that shone lustrously in the light that
came down through the smoke-hole, leggings
of soft deer-hide much ornamented with
quills and beads, several strings and anklets
of wampum. His head was shaven to the
scalp-lock, and that was bound with bits of
red cloth until it stood upright a good eight
inches, and was lavishly strung with bright
feathers. Several rings encircled the fingers
of the left hand, and on his naked chest
where the panther-skin fell away a great
round disk of silver rudely chased with some
design rose with each slow inhalation of
smoke and fell again as the evil-smelling
fumes poured forth from mouth or nose.
After a first gravely appraising look, the sachem
had not again observed David. His
eyes remained on the kettle, now noisily bubbling,
quite as though life held nothing more
in prospect than the morning meal.</p>

<p>The sachem’s squaw was a quite young
woman, but to David’s mind horribly fat and
ugly, with crossed-eyes and a flattish nose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
She was dressed with no pretension to rank
and wore few ornaments. Although as wife
of the sagamore she held the position of
queen, she was in effect little more than a
household drudge. Presently, squatting beside
the fire, she thrust a wooden spoon into
the pot, withdrew it, and held it to her lips.
Then she passed it to the sachem. He, too,
tasted, but shook his head silently. Children
and dogs watched the performance with intentness.
When another minute had passed,
the entrance was darkened and a small, wiry
Indian, naked save for breech-cloth and a
multitude of ornaments that depended from
neck and arms, knees and ankles, entered
followed by three others. The sachem
grunted a word or two and David was thrust
forward until he stood but a yard or two
from him. The newcomer, evidently a powwow,
or medicine man, stood at his right and
Sequanawah at his other side. Again the sachem
spoke and the powwow translated in
excellent English.</p>

<p>“Great Sachem asks what name, brother.”</p>

<p>“David Lindall.”</p>

<p>“How come here?”</p>

<p>David stared from sachem to interpreter.
“You ought to know that,” he answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
bitterly. “This Indian caught and bound me
and brought me here.”</p>

<p>The sachem thereupon directed his words
to Sequanawah, and the latter made an explanation,
a word or two of which David was
able to understand.</p>

<p>Presently the powwow said blandly: “Sequanawah
say you come to village where he
watch and ask food. He bring you to Great
Sachem. Why you lie?”</p>

<p>“I tell no lie,” answered David wonderingly.
“I not understand. He capture me
yesterday near my home, many leagues
away. He had two others with him. They
put cloth between my teeth so that I could
not cry out and bound my hands behind my
back. All night we travel. What story is this
he tells?”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say hold out hands.”
David obeyed.</p>

<p>“They not bound,” said the powwow.</p>

<p>“He released them ere I entered here.”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say he not believe your
story. Great Sachem good friend of English.
All his people friends of English people. No
would steal you. Great Sachem say maybe
you sick in head. You think?”</p>

<p>David looked in puzzlement at the sachem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
and their eyes met. The chief’s face was all
innocence and candor, but at the back of
the dark eyes, like sparks in a dead fire, were
glints of guile, and David understood.</p>

<p>“I know only what I have told,” he answered
the powwow. “If I have dreamed, so
be it. Give me food, for I am faint, and I
will return to my home.”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say yes. Say all English
men his brothers. Say when they not deal
honestly with him, they still his brothers.
Maybe you know English take his son
Nausauwah and put him in prison.”</p>

<p>David nodded. “He was suspected of setting
fire to an Englishman’s barn. He is to
be fairly tried by the court in Boston.”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say Englishman’s law not
Indian’s law. Say how can he know Nausauwah
get justice.”</p>

<p>“Tell him that the English always deal
justly,” replied David stoutly. “Ask him
when they have done otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say English take much
lands from Indian and build fences about
and Indians no can go in for hunt.”</p>

<p>“The English always pay for the lands.
When they are planted, they are no longer
for hunting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“Great Sachem say maybe English kill
Nausauwah. Maybe make him slave far
across sea. Great Sachem love his son and
no want it so. Maybe your father have same
love to you. Not want you hurt or killed.
You think?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” answered the boy steadily.</p>

<p>“Great Sachem think so too. Maybe English
send his son back to him pretty soon.
You think?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, but if he is not guilty,
he will go free. But first he will be tried.”</p>

<p>“When you think he be tried?”</p>

<p>“Soon. Ere this, doubtless, had not the
trouble in the Plymouth Colony disturbed
those in Boston.”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say what trouble at Plymouth.”</p>

<p>“King Philip, as we call him, has taken
wicked counsel and has killed many of the
English and burned their homes.” If David
expected evidences of surprise, he was disappointed.
The sachem received the news
placidly, as did the others, and David concluded
that they had already known it.
“The English have sent many soldiers to
punish King Philip,” he added sternly,
“and he will be very sorrowful indeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“Great Sachem say Pometacom very
wicked,” announced the powwow smoothly.
“Say he must get plenty punishment like
bad child. Say Wachoosett people very angry
with Pometacom.”</p>

<p>“Aye. Say to the Great Sachem that all
Indians except Philip’s tribe have declared
friendship for the English and that many
will fight for them if need be.”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say he glad to know. Say
Wachoosett Indians very peaceful. No make
war with English. No make war with Pometacom.
Wachoosett people everybody’s brother.
No make meddle any time.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” said David. “And now,
brother, give me food and I will go back by
the trail I came.”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say you rest first. No
hurry you go away. He say you have plenty
food, plenty sleep. He say you his brother,
his heart warm to you. He say you stay here
little time and make talk with him. Then he
give you Indians show you trail and keep you
safe from Pometacom.”</p>

<p>“When will that be?” asked David, his
heart sinking.</p>

<p>“Little time. Great Sachem give you
lodge, give you food, give you all to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
happy. Give you plenty servant. You like
maybe so?”</p>

<p>“Tell the great Sachem that I thank him
for his kindness, but that I must return to
my home, for my father does not know where
I am and will be sorrowful.”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say his heart weep for
your father. Say he send message to him so
he not trouble for you. Say you stay here
and be brother for little time he much like.”</p>

<p>“Talk plainly!” cried David, patience at
an end. “You mean to keep me prisoner.
So be it! But say to your sachem that
whether I go or stay will make no difference
to his son, for he will be held until tried and
if guilty will be punished. And say to him
that my people will seek me, and will know
where to seek, as well, and when I am found
it will go hard with him, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say you talk without
thought,” answered the powwow gently.
“You his brother. He no make prisoner his
brother. English may so, but he not. You
have long journey. Forest hide many enemies.
You stay here and have plenty rest.
Then you go home all safe. Great Sachem
very kind heart for English brother.”</p>

<p>“I am in your hands,” replied David bitterly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
“I have no choice, ’twould seem, but
accept your hospitality, O Maker of Magic.
So I pray you bring me to a place where I
may rest.”</p>

<p>Sequanawah laid a hand on his sleeve.
“You come,” he said.</p>

<p>As David turned away, he caught again
the mocking gleam that lay at the back of
the sachem’s placid gaze.</p>

<p>The village was fully awake now, and men
old and young sat by the doors of the wigwams
or moved among them, and women
were at their tasks in the first rays of sunlight
that came around the green-clad shoulder
of the mountain. Dogs snarled and
fought underfoot over the bones thrown to
them from the dwellings. Young boys ran
and shouted or sat in circles at their games.
David’s passing elicited only the faintest interest
amongst the older Indians, but the
young boys and children, most of whom had
doubtless never before set eyes on a white-face,
regarded him with unconcealed curiosity.
Many left their play and followed to
the far side of the stockade where a wigwam
stood slightly removed from the rest. Into
this Sequanawah conducted the prisoner.
A very old woman crouched above a fire on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
which some fish cooked in a stone basin.
She glanced up briefly and then dropped her
watery eyes again to her task.</p>

<p>“You live here,” said Sequanawah. “Nice
place. Old woman she make food. Young
Indian soon come be servant. You want,
you say.” He dropped his voice. “Inside
wall you all right. Outside no can go.
Great Sachem say, ‘Catch um outside, kill
um quick.’ Farewell.”</p>

<p>“Farewell,” replied David.</p>

<p>When the Indian had gone, he threw himself
wearily on the rough hide that formed
the nearest approach to a bed that his new
dwelling afforded and moodily watched the
ancient crone scatter the fire and then place
the smoking basin of fish at his side. He
nodded his thanks, and then, as the squaw
seemed not inclined to leave him, but would
have settled herself across the wigwam, he
made signs toward the entrance, and, since
she was either too weak of sight or stupid
of mind to comprehend, he said, “Mauncheak,
mauncheak!” which signifies “Go
away.” That she heard and understood, and
pulled her old body from the ground with a
groan and toddled out. He ate a little of the
fish, which was none so bad save that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
lacked the seasoning he was used to—for
the Indians used no salt in their cooking—and
then lay back and, with his hands beneath
his head, stared upward at the sun-patterned
roof of this strange house and gave
himself over to thought. From without came
the low hum of voices, the snarling and barking
of dogs, the thud of a stone axe on timber,
and at times the shrill shouting of the
boys at play. The sounds were all foreign
and unaccustomed and David’s heart sank
as a fuller realization of his predicament
came to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<small>THE VILLAGE OF THE WACHOOSETTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was clear to him that, so long as the sachem’s
son was neither harmed nor deported
into slavery, his own safety was assured, but
if the court in Boston presently put Nausauwah
to trial and ordered him executed, which
was not beyond the possibilities, or sent to
the Indies, his life would not be worth a
grain of corn. Therefore, thought the boy, it
behooved him somehow to manage an escape
before Nausauwah’s fate was decided. Fortunately,
he believed, the troubles with King
Philip might well delay the sitting of the
court beyond its usual time.</p>

<p>Woosonametipom had made him hostage
to ensure the safety of his son, but, lest he
bring the English about his ears, was prepared
to deny the fact: for which purpose
he had invented the story that David had
wandered to the Indian village and asked for
food and shelter. Should David’s friends
come there seeking him, which they would
do of a surety, Metipom would either hide
him and deny all knowledge of him or turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
him over to the rescuers with the assertion
that he had sought the Wachoosetts’ hospitality
and had been cared for by them as a
guest. Possibly they would say that he was
ill or out of his mind and that they had
healed him. It was not a likely story, nor
would it be believed in the face of the boy’s
denials, but it might serve its purpose of
calming the Englishmen’s wrath. Moreover,
without a doubt every inhabitant of the village
would gravely testify to the truth of it.
As David knew, the Indians were poor liars,
trusting far less to plausibility than to dogged
persistence. The story might well answer
Metipom’s purpose and “save his face.”</p>

<p>But David did not believe that the sachem
would give him up on demand, for in such
case he would have gained nothing and
would have antagonized the English. It was
far more likely that he would deny any
knowledge of him and yet subtly contrive to
let the seekers understand that, when Nausauwah
was returned safely to his tribe, David
Lindall would reappear. No matter how
strong their suspicions might be, David’s
friends would hesitate to wreak vengeance
without some proof. Doubtless Metipom
would invite them to search the village and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
question his men, which, with David well
hidden in the forest and the inhabitants told
what answers to give, would lead to nothing.
Thus he reasoned, knowing much of Indian
ways and character both from personal experience
and hearsay, and reasoned well as
events proved.</p>

<p>In the end it appeared clear to him that
if he was to escape from his captors, it must
be by efforts of his own; that help from
outside was not to be depended on. It might
be that the authorities in Boston would decide
to release Nausauwah in exchange for
David. Doubtless Master Vernham, who
was not without influence in the town, would
use his good offices. And there was Uncle
William, as well: and perhaps others. And
yet David knew how firm those Puritans
stood for Law and Justice, and it might well
be that their consciences would sternly refuse
such a compromise. Such a solution of
his difficulties was, he concluded, more than
uncertain.</p>

<p>Remained, therefore, first of all, to study
well his prison and acquaint himself with
the manner in which it was guarded, for
which purpose it would be well to seem reconciled
to his fate, maintaining a cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
countenance and making friends as he might.
By such means he might allay suspicion and
gain added liberty. And having reached this
sensible decision, David closed his eyes and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke the sun was past the
meridian and the shadows had begun to
lengthen. The wigwam was hot and breathless
and he was parched with thirst. At the
entrance he almost stepped on a young Indian
half asleep there, his naked body, heavily
smeared with oil, glistening in the hot
sunlight. He was a comely, well-proportioned
youth, in age perhaps twenty, with a
rather livelier expression than common to
his people.</p>

<p>He grunted as David’s foot encountered
him and looked up inquiringly. “What um
want?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Water,” David answered. The Indian
seemed not to know the word and so David
said, “Nippe,” although not certain that it
would be more successful, since the Nipmuck
equivalent of “water” varied in different
localities, as did many other words. But the
youth understood and sprang to his moccasined
feet.</p>

<p>“You come,” he said, and led the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
past many wigwams to where a spring issued
forth from beneath a granite ledge. A
rude box of small logs, barked and chinked
with clay, had been laid about the mouth of
the spring so that the water was held ere it
trickled away in a little runnel across the
gently sloping ground. As there was no vessel
to drink from, David knelt and dipped
his mouth to the pool and drank deeply,
though the water was lukewarm from standing
in the sun. When he had finished, feeling
vastly refreshed, the Indian took his place.
But instead of following David’s method, he
scooped the water up in his right hand and
bore it to his lips, and did it so quickly and
deftly that scarcely a drop was wasted.
Whereupon David attempted the same trick
and failed, the water running down over
his wrist ere he could get his mouth to his
palm. There was a grunt from the Indian
and David saw that the latter was greatly
amused.</p>

<p>“You show how,” laughed David.</p>

<p>The Indian youth smiled broadly and
obeyed, and after several attempts David at
length succeeded in mastering the trick fairly
well, and his instructor applauded with many
nods and said, “Good! Good!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>David moved away and, observing that the
Indian did not accompany him, said, “You
come.” The young brave bowed and fell in
behind. “What name you?” David asked.</p>

<p>“John.”</p>

<p>“John? Have you no Indian name?”
The other seemed not to understand the
question, and later David found that his
attendant’s knowledge of English was very
limited. “You got more name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Me John,” repeated the Indian.</p>

<p>“John—what?”</p>

<p>The other shook his head and David gave
up.</p>

<p>The village was quiet, even the dogs being
for the most part fast asleep in the shade of
the wigwams. Here and there a squaw or a
maiden sat at the entrance of a lodge preparing
food or working with cloth or buckskin.
Few men were in sight, for the Indians
chose to sleep in the heat of the day,
or, failing sleep, to lie still within the wigwams
and smoke their pipes. As he made a
circuit of the village, David observed well.
He judged that the ground within the palisade
might well be an acre and a half in
extent. It did not form any approach to a
true circle, but adjusted itself to the shape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of the sloping plateau. Before it, as David
recalled, lay a hillside of grass and thicket
and then the forest. Back of it, as he could
see, the side of the mountain sloped more
steeply, strewn with ledges and rocks, but
the forest did not begin again for some distance,
perhaps an eighth of a mile. It seemed
to him that, while the fort might be well
enough disposed against attack by savages,
an enemy armed with muskets could do no
little damage from the edge of the forest
above, although the distance was too great
to permit of accurate shooting. The palisade
was high and strong, the top of each log being
sharply pointed. A few peep-holes, no
larger than one might speed an arrow or
thrust a spear through, had been left at certain
places in the English fashion. Two platforms
of saplings lashed together with strips
of hide or twisted roots offered posts of observation
above the wall. The gate or door
was narrow and was closed by a roughly-hewn
barricade of oak planks so heavy that
David doubted the ability of fewer than three
men to move it into place.</p>

<p>The sachem’s wigwam stood by itself near
the center of the enclosure and was larger
than any other and more elaborately adorned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
with pictures and hieroglyphics in red and
brown and black pigments. Before the door
two poles were set in the ground from each
of which depended objects that aroused the
boy’s curiosity. Nearing them, he saw that
the right-hand pole held a dead owl suspended
by a cord from one foot and that the
other was decorated with a bunch of rushes
tied about with a strip of blue cotton cloth
through which was thrust a long white
feather.</p>

<p>He turned to John and pointed. “What
for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Medicine,” was the reply.</p>

<p>What virtue lay in either a dead owl or
a bunch of marsh rushes, David was at a
loss to know, but Indian “medicine” as
interpreted by the powwows was a thing beyond
understanding.</p>

<p>There seemed to be about fifty wigwams
within the fort, and later David estimated
the inhabitants to be approximately two
hundred in number, of which fully half
were women and children below the fighting
age. As Indian villages went, this one of the
Wachoosetts’ was well-ordered and fairly
clean. There was apparently no system in
the disposition of the lodges, every one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
building where it pleased him. So far as
guarding against attack went, David could
not see that any precaution was being taken.
But in this he was wrong, as he afterwards
discovered.</p>

<p>It took but a short time to make a circuit
of the village during which he saw few inhabitants
and occasioned no apparent interest
in any. Returning to his own abode for
want of a better place, he found a shaded
space on one side and seated himself, motioning
John to do likewise. During his trip of
inspection he had held little conversation
with the Indian, for it is difficult to talk comfortably
with a companion who insists on
walking squarely behind you, and all David’s
scheming had failed to induce John to
walk elsewhere than behind. Now, however,
David began the self-imposed task of improving
himself in the Nipmuck language.</p>

<p>Pointing to his hand, he asked: “What
name?”</p>

<p>“Nitchicke,” replied John.</p>

<p>Then David pointed to his arm.</p>

<p>“Napet.” The Indian understood the
game now and became interested, and presently
he was in turn asking, “What name?”</p>

<p>His efforts to pronounce the English words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
were doubtless no more amusing than David’s
attempts at the Indian, but David
thought them so! John took no offense at
the other’s laughter, but sometimes smiled
widely himself when his tongue refused to
conform to the demands of an L or an R.
David did not continue too long at the lesson,
preferring to memorize a few words
thoroughly rather than to half-learn a great
many. But the sun had lengthened its
shadows much and the intense heat of the
early afternoon was gone by the time he dismissed
his school. John disappeared amidst
the wigwams across the enclosure, and David,
setting in mental array the few facts he
had gleaned from his journey of the fort, set
his mind to fashioning a means of escape.
But he did not look for success at the first
attempt, nor did he win it. The problem was
not one to be lightly solved, if at all, and in
any event he must first determine how closely
he was guarded at night.</p>

<p>The village became awake again as the
afternoon drew to its end. Hunters departed
through the gate, women and children went
to seek berries and fruits, dogs aroused
themselves and prowled for food, large boys
squatted in circles and played their strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
games, younger ones romped boisterously,
dodging in and out from the lodges with
mocking cries. Sometimes a papoose whimpered
hungrily, but for the most part the
little creamy-skinned, big-eyed babies were
as silent as though Nature had denied them
tongues. Smoke began to appear above the
tops of the wigwams, ascending straight in
air like blue pencils of vapor. More often,
though, the evening fires were built in front
of the wigwam doors. Women, young and
old, busied themselves with the stone or
metal pots in which nearly everything was
cooked. At the nearer wigwam an older
squaw was cutting a piece of blood-dripping
flesh into thin strips, chanting a song softly
as she worked. Her fire was no more than a
few small fagots enclosed between two flat
stones that supported the iron kettle. The
strips of meat were dropped into the kettle
as cut and to David they looked far from
appetizing. He presumed that there was water
in the pot, and after a while, as he
watched idly, a faint steam arose from it
and proved him right. The squaw went into
the wigwam and presently returned holding
something that looked like gray meal in her
cupped hands. This she dropped slowly into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the kettle, afterwards stirring it with her
wooden spoon. That done, she brought forth
two stones, one flat with a hollowed space in
one surface and the other somewhat pear-shaped
and smaller. Into the hollow of the
larger stone she dropped a few kernels of
corn, taken from a leather pouch, and began
to crush them, holding the pear-shaped stone
by its smaller end and dropping it on the
grain with a circular movement of her thin
brown wrist. When the corn was broken
to her liking, she scooped it forth onto a
piece of birch bark and dipped again into
the pouch.</p>

<p>While she was so occupied, a rather stout
Indian emerged from the wigwam, stretching
and yawning, and, after blinking a moment
at the sun, seated himself with his back to
a lodge-pole and leisurely filled the small
bowl of his long blue-clay pipe. When it
was ready he spoke to the woman and she,
leaving her rude mortar and pestle, picked
a hot coal from the fire with her bare fingers
and gave it to him. Unconcernedly he took
it from her, though it glowed so brightly
that David could see it in the sunlight, and
held it to the pipe-bowl. Then, emitting
streamers of smoke from his nostrils, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
tossed the ember aside and settled himself
contentedly. He smoked in the manner of
his people, taking but one inhalation at a
time and expelling it slowly, meanwhile
holding the pipe away as though it had no
more interest for him. Often a full minute
elapsed between puffs, and David wondered
that the pipe did not go out. The smoker was
elderly and David guessed that he was lazy
as well.</p>

<p>The ancient crone who had prepared David’s
breakfast for him now came waddling
to the wigwam bearing a birchen tray
whereon lay a piece of meat and some dried
beans. The meat looked to be three or four
ribs of some small animal, and David, knowing
that the Indians were more partial than
averse to dogs as food, shuddered and resolved
to touch none of the meat until he
had learned its kind. The old woman stopped
where he sat and lowered the tray for his
inspection, muttering a word or two of gibberish
in a husky, whining voice. David
looked, inwardly revolted, and nodded.
There was, he knew, no use in asking her
what sort of flesh it was, since she knew no
word of English and his own knowledge of
Nipmuck was not yet equal to comprehending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
what she might reply. Perhaps, too, he
feared that reply might be “Awnam,” which
he believed to signify “dog.” She disappeared
inside with her treasures, and presently
he heard the faint crackling of the
wood as the flames took hold. How she had
started the fire he could not imagine, for
there had seemed to be only lifeless embers
there before her coming, and she had surely
not brought fire with her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his neighbors were partaking of
their meal. The stout Indian held a pointed
stick in his hand and with it speared the
strips of half-cooked meat from the kettle
which the squaw had placed before him
where he sat. From the kettle the meat went
straight to his mouth, dripping upon him,
whereupon, having laid aside his pipe, he
used his hands to tear it apart or thrust
it in. A few feet away the squaw sat on her
heels, silently watchful. Occasionally, and
only occasionally, the man, having drawn
forth a strip of meat whose looks he did not
favor, held it forth to the woman and she
seized it from the end of the stick and transferred
it quickly and hungrily to her mouth.
Once the morsel dropped from the point of
the stick to the earth, but she showed no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
hesitation, rescuing it and not tarrying to
see that it was clean ere she ate it. Between
mouthfuls of meat they partook of the
cracked corn. David, although no stranger
to Indian manners, turned his eyes away in
distaste.</p>

<p>About the village many other families
were eating or preparing to eat, although as
many more had evidently no thought for
food. At the Natick village the Praying Indians
had for some years conformed roughly
to the English fashion of eating meals at
regular and prescribed intervals, but the native
custom of eating when hungry still held
here. For that reason, so long as he remained,
David could always, no matter at
what time of day or early evening, find some
one preparing food or consuming it. The
Nipmucks were not great flesh-eaters, especially
in the summer, he found, preferring
vegetables and grains and fruits with an occasional
meal of fish. As time wore on he
discovered that his own food came from the
sachem’s stores and that it was evidently
chosen for him with regard to the Indian’s
notion of what the white man preferred.
Thus he was served with meat always once
a day, although he would more often have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
chosen to do without it, and fish was frequent.
Also a certain regularity was observed
by his ancient handmaiden, his morning
meal being prepared for him ere he was more
than half awake—indeed, it was often the
fumes of the fire or the moving about of the
squaw that aroused him—and the evening
meal coming at about five in the afternoon.
Not infrequently at first he grew hungry long
before the second meal appeared, missing
the hearty midday dinner to which he was
accustomed, but before long he grew used to
the new arrangement. Had he sought food
at such times as he wished it, he would not
have had far to seek, for the Indian, whatever
faults he had, was never inhospitable.
To tarry near where a family was eating was
sufficient to draw an invitation, as David discovered
one day. On that occasion, although
he had no stomach for it, he partook of a
loathsome stew of doubtful ingredients
rather than seem discourteous, for it was his
effort to make as many friends as he might.</p>

<p>This evening, ere his meal was ready for
him, John returned, and to him David put
the question: “What meat does the squaw
cook?” After some difficulty John was made
to understand and he went inside and spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
to the squaw. When he returned he said,
“Squaw say ‘pequas.’”</p>

<p>“Pequas” meant fox, and David considered
the matter for a minute. He had heard
of foxes being eaten by the Indians: even on
occasion by the English settlers, though not
from choice; but it seemed to him that to
have turned up his nose at dog-meat and now
approve of fox-meat was foolish, for, save
that one ran wild and other was tame, there
could be little to choose between them. As a
result of his cogitation, he ate little supper,
for the half-boiled beans were both few and
wretched. John ate the meat without demur.</p>

<p>Later they talked again as the darkness
crept up the mountain and the scattered fires
made orange-hued glows about the village.
The talk was halting, however, and difficult,
and before long David went to his hard couch
and John, drawing his skin cloak about his
bronze shoulders, squatted without the doorway
and smoked. David’s thoughts that
night were wistful of home and his father,
but not for long since sleep soon came to
his still wearied body.</p>

</div>


<p>On the morrow he was summoned to the
sachem, and on entering the big wigwam
found it half full of Indians. Most of them
were young men, although a few were of
middle-age and one quite old. In all there
were some eighteen or twenty including the
sachem himself and the interpreter of yesterday.
The sachem’s wife and the three
children hovered in the background, and the
dogs slunk about underfoot, as ever.</p>

<p>David bowed and gave the Nipmuck salutation
and those present gravely responded.
From the size of the audience and the air of
gravity prevailing, David judged that Metipom
had assembled his counselors to learn
what the white man could tell them of the
trouble between King Philip and the English.
His surmise was soon proved correct, for
after the sachem had inquired politely as to
his “guest’s” state of health and appetite,
and had expressed the grave hope that he
had enjoyed much sleep, he began, through
the powwow, to question David about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
acts of the “wicked-hearted Pometacom.”
That the sachem had already received definite
and fairly full information of the Wampanoags’
insurrection was evident from the
questions put. What Metipom and his counselors
seemed most wishful of knowing was
whether the Narragansett tribe would join
Philip or the English. To this David truthfully
answered that the Narragansetts had
given their promise to remain neutral. The
sachem then asked if the Quaboags had not
cast in their lot with Pometacom. This David
could not answer. He was asked about
various other small tribes; the Nausets, the
Pegans, and Niantics, and still more whose
names he now heard for the first time. Of
the Pegans he said that they were friends of
the English and would remain so, having
Monapikot’s word for it. The Niantics he
supposed to be of the Narragansett people,
and they would take no part. As to the
Nausets he knew nothing. His answers were
discussed at length by the chief and his
counselors, but whether they agreed or no
with what information they already held
David could not guess. In the end he was
sent away courteously enough, leaving the
assemblage still squatting about the wigwam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>He had thought when bidden to the sachem’s
lodge that his friends had come for
him or sent overtures by some friendly Indian.
Now, wandering about the dog-infested
village, he found himself wondering
why they had not done either. Surely, he
reasoned, his absence could have gone unnoted
no later than nightfall two days previous.
His father might wait until morning
before giving the alarm, but after that, action
would, it seemed to him, be speedy. After
the challenge of the blue-marked arrow it
was not likely that his father would fail to
connect his disappearance with Woosonametipom.
Surely, he concluded, the rescue
party would arrive not later than this evening.</p>

<p>Having reached the gate of the fort, he
paused and looked forth. Several Indians
were listlessly stirring the soil of little patches
of tobacco, beans, corn, and squashes set
between the outcropping boulders and
patches of brush. None challenged him, and
he was considering stepping outside to test
the sachem’s watchfulness when a mop of
black hair thrust itself into sight from about
a corner of the wall and a scowling countenance
confronted him. “No can,” growled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
the sentinel. He placed his wooden spear
across the gateway and rattled it fearsomely.
David drew back. As he did so his glance
lifted to the nearer of the two watch towers.
Against the hot haze of the noonday sky a
straight and motionless figure stood like a
statue in bronze and gazed southward. With
vastly more respect for Metipom’s vigilance,
David went slowly and thoughtfully back
toward his wigwam.</p>

<p>Some of the younger lads were practicing
shooting with their bows and arrows, their
mark the bowl of a broken clay pipe which
they had set up against the peeled logs of
the palisade. David paused and looked on.
Their bows were smaller than those of their
fathers and their arrows shorter, and the
range was not long, but David was surprised
at the accuracy of their marksmanship. One
youth, whose age could have been no more
than ten, twice set the thorn-tipped head of
his arrow close beside the tiny target, whereat
David exclaimed, “Winnet! Winnet!”
(“Good! Good!”), and the others began to
cry “Winnet!” too, more, it seemed, for the
sake of noise than aught else, while the
small, naked boy, whose skin was the color
of a young fawn, marched about with ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
pompousness and chanted “Sasketup!”
which meant “a great man.” So absurd
were the rascal’s actions that David burst
into a laugh, and that produced scowls and
mutterings from the youth, for the Indians
were sensitive to derision and the lad mistook
David’s amusement for ridicule. He
stopped in his march of triumph, shook his
small bow angrily, and launched into a shrill
jumble of words, few of which David could
understand. At their companion’s anger the
others howled gleefully, jumping about and
striking attitudes. It seemed that what the
boy was pouring forth was a challenge, for
now he held forth his bow and an arrow and
pointed to the mark. David, who had seldom
attempted so difficult a shot with the native
weapon, although he had frequently used a
bow when hunting with Monapikot, hesitated.
Whereupon the incensed lad became
the more derisive, and his playmates, transferring
their sympathies, joined in the chorus
of taunts.</p>

<p>“Nay, then, I’ll try it,” said David, and
accepted the bow and arrow.</p>

<p>They were scarcely more than toys to his
long arms and the pipe-bowl looked very
small. But he set the notch into the string,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
drew, and shot. The arrow, lighter than he
had reckoned, stuck its head more than a foot
below the mark, although on a good line
with it. “Sasketup” viewed the result with
supreme contempt, and the comments of his
companions were, while unintelligible to David,
plainly unflattering.</p>

<p>“Arrow him too short,” said a voice behind
him, and David turned to see Sequanawah,
his captor of two days ago. Sequanawah
took an arrow from one of the larger
boys and held it forth. “You try um,” he
said. David had better fortune this time, for
the arrow struck less than an inch above the
mark. “Winnet!” grunted the boys and
“Good shoot,” said Sequanawah.</p>

<p>Several of the youths crowded about David
and offered their arrows for him to try,
but he shook his head, laughing, thinking it
well to stop before he had, by a worse shot,
destroyed what renown he had gained. The
lad who had challenged scowled crestfallenly
as David turned away and called a shrill
taunt after him. The words David did not
know, but their meaning was evident enough:
“I dare you to try again, Englishman!”</p>

<p>To David’s surprise, Sequanawah accompanied
him to the wigwam and there squatted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
inside with the manner of one paying a visit
of ceremony. Gravely David offered hospitality.</p>

<p>“Will you eat meat?” he asked.</p>

<p>Sequanawah shook his head. “Me full.”</p>

<p>In that case, as David knew, he should
offer pipe and tobacco. Not having either,
however, he smiled and pointed to the pouch
that hung at the Indian’s girdle. “You
smoke,” he said.</p>

<p>Sequanawah bowed and drew pipe and
pouch to his knees and filled his bowl gravely
and in silence. That done, he searched in
the blackened embers of the fire and presently
brought forth a tiny coal that showed
a gray ash. On this he breathed gently.
The flakey ash disappeared and gradually a
glow of fire took its place. To David the
performance smacked of the miraculous, for
he would have sworn that the ember was as
dead as any that Sequanawah had cast
aside. When his pipe was lighted, the
Wachoosett smoked for a minute in silence,
his dark eyes fixed on the ground. Then he
laid the pipe beside him and spoke.</p>

<p>“Um well?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Aye, brother.”</p>

<p>The Indian nodded as with satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
“David man good shoot,” he went on. “Um
shoot plenty um shoot more good. Um got
cossaquot?”</p>

<p>“Cossaquot?” repeated David.</p>

<p>“Aye, cossaquot.” He drew an imaginary
bow-string, snapped his thumb and forefinger
apart, and gazed through the wigwam
door.</p>

<p>“You mean bow and arrows? Nay, I no
got cossaquot, brother.”</p>

<p>“Me make um you plenty good. You
shoot um all-time. You be good shoot, good
fight, good hunt.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Sequanawah; I should like
that.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” grunted the Indian.</p>

<p>Conversation lapsed. Sequanawah replaced
the stem of his pipe between his lips
and smoked awhile. At last he emptied the
ashes from the bowl, arose and walked to the
entrance. There he turned, laid a hand on
his heart, and then pointed to David. “Sequanawah
um brother,” he said simply.
“Nawhaw nissis.”</p>

<p>“Farewell,” returned David. “May your
meat do you much good.”</p>

<p>He was glad to have gained Sequanawah’s
friendship, although whether it would profit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
him any remained to be seen. Sequanawah
had attended the conference in the sachem’s
wigwam that morning, which indicated that
he was a counselor and one of the tribe’s
principal men, perhaps a captain amongst the
warriors. In which case his avowal of friendship
might result most fortunately. Later,
David sought to learn more of Sequanawah
from John, but the latter’s English was too
povern.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon, toward the end of
the sleep-hour, when David, seated rather
disconsolately in the shade outside his lodge,
saw two Indians approaching. He knew
neither by sight, although he had already
learned to recognize a good many of the inhabitants
of the village. Both were young
men and each was armed with tomahawk,
knife, and spear. They motioned to him to
accompany them and he did so. They led the
way toward the sachem’s lodge, but instead
of entering they went past. From within the
wigwam David heard the voice of Woosonametipom
and another. The two Indians went
on toward the gate. David saw that the
watch tower was no longer occupied. At the
opening in the palisade one of the Indians
fell in behind David and they passed through.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
So far as the boy could see, the gate was no
longer guarded. Looking down the slope
toward the belt of forest, his gaze was attracted
by a faint column of smoke that
seemed to arise from the meadow beyond the
forest. The garden patches were deserted
and the leaves of the tobacco plants hung
limply in the hot sun. To the left they went,
making their way between bushes and over
brambles and following no perceptible trail
until the shadow of the woods met them.
Keeping at the edge of the trees, the Indian
who led proceeded for the better part of a
mile, thus presently losing sight of the village
as the curve of the hill intervened. It
was hot and sultry and the pace was fast,
and David, being well weighted with clothing
in comparison with his companions, was
soon in a fine perspiration.</p>

<p>He wondered greatly where they were
taking him and why. He had, however, no
fear. If harm was to come to him, it would
come in the village, for the Indians would
make a public event of his torture or execution
and not conduct either secretly. What
seemed the most probable was that the Indian
outposts had sent word that his friends
were approaching and that he was being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
taken away to some place of hiding. When,
after another half-mile, the leader turned
down the slope and entered a park-like expanse
of oaks and at last came to a stop,
David knew that his surmise had been correct.
Before them was a ledge of rock outcropping
from the forest floor. A giant oak
with a twisted trunk sent sprawling roots
above and about it, and one root, the taproot
as it seemed, had gone straight down
through a crevice in the ledge and, gradually
increasing in size, had forced the rock apart
so that there lay a narrow opening, half-hidden
by ferns. Into this the first Indian
squirmed and was instantly gone from sight.
Somewhat hesitantly, David followed, and
being clothed and wider of shoulder, would
have stuck in the aperture had not the second
Indian shoved upon him. Thereupon
David went free and found his feet scrabbling
on broken particles of stone and himself in
a sudden and confusing darkness.</p>

<p>“Hub,” said the Indian ahead, and as
“hub” meant “come,” David, feeling his
way, followed. For several paces the path led
steeply downward. Then the earth became
level and David stopped. Behind him the
second Indian was scuffling softly down to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
join them. As his eyes accustomed themselves
to the change from daylight to gloom,
David made out dimly that he was standing
in a roomy cave. It appeared to be a half-dozen
paces in width, more than the height
of a man from floor to roof and of indeterminable
depth. It was refreshingly cool down
there. David’s companions seated themselves
between him and the narrow passage
that led upward and out, and through which
the daylight entered subduedly, and stolidly
filled their pipes. There being naught else
to do, David likewise seated himself on the
ground, finding a spot where the wall of rock
provided a rest for his shoulders. The floor
of the cave was dry, seeming to consist of the
powdered particles of the granite ledge above,
although, as he discovered after being seated
awhile, there were occasional sharp fragments
of stone as well.</p>

<p>He wondered how long he would have to
stay there. The thought that even now his
father or others from his country might be no
more than two miles distant filled him with
discouragement and a sort of dull anger.
They would be welcomed by the sachem and
entertained with food and tobacco, and all
their questioning would come to naught.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
Though they searched high and low and
never so carefully they would find no trace
of him. Sitting there in the half-light of the
cavern, the only sound the soft sucking of
the Indians’ pipes, the boy’s thoughts were
far from happy, and once his eyes grew moist
ere, with a shrug of impatience for his weakness,
he forced back the tears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<small>THE CAVE IN THE FOREST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When the light that came in by the narrow
cleft in the ledge had grown dim, the Indians
produced food, dried fish that smelled none
too good and parched corn, and shared them
with the captive. David was not hungry, but
ate as he might, for the idea of making his
escape ere the night was over had come to
him, and should he find an opportunity to
make the attempt he would be better for
food in his stomach. After the brief meal
one of the Indians disappeared and presently
returned with water in a fold of birch
bark. By then the cave was utterly black
and David could no longer see his companions.
The latter, who had spoken to each
other but seldom during the afternoon, now
became talkative, and David amused himself
in trying to understand something of
their conversation. But it was no use, for,
although now and then a sound that was
familiar came to him, the most of it was
gibberish. Perhaps two hours passed, and
then once more the entrance to the cave was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
illumined, though but dimly, as the starlight
flooded the open wood. David was resolved
to let no chance go by, and for that
reason fought hard against the sleep that
weighted his eyelids. If, he reasoned, he could
in some manner get past the Indians and
through the entrance without their knowledge,
he might elude them in the gloom of
the forest and, by traveling eastward, discover
the trail leading to Sudbury and there
lie in wait for the returning party of his
friends. The Indians gradually ceased their
talk and silence fell again. At last one of
them stirred and spoke briefly. The other responded
with a grunt and the entrance was
darkened momentarily as the first speaker
slipped out of the cavern.</p>

<p>David lay down then and simulated slumber,
breathing regularly. He would have
given much to have known whither the other
savage had gone; whether back to the village
or only to some post of watching near by.
Peering across the cave, he saw the glow of
the Indian’s pipe at intervals. Then it went
out and silence settled more deeply. After a
long while the Indian muttered, sighed, and
then began to breathe heavily and with a
rasping sound. David’s heart beat fast while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
he waited for his jailer to sink more deeply
in slumber. Ten minutes passed, and then,
with only such sound as was caused by his
knees and toes on the gravel floor, he started
to creep toward the entrance. To reach it he
must pass close to the Indian, for the latter
was near the middle of the cave, his form discernible
against the faint light of the opening.
He had not laid himself down, but had
fallen asleep where he sat, his head fallen
forward on his chest.</p>

<p>A few inches at a time was all David dared
attempt, ready to sink to the ground and pretend
sleep at the first token of wakefulness
on the part of the savage. When he had
brought himself to within arm’s reach of the
sleeper, the latter’s breathing broke in a mutter
and the boy dropped to the floor and lay
very still. The Indian stirred, changed his
position slightly, it seemed, and then, when a
long moment had passed, sank back to sleep.
David’s heart was beating so hard and so
fast that the sound of it, like the ticking of a
great clock, seemed to fill the cavern, and
he almost expected that the noise of it would
awaken the Indian.</p>

<p>At last he was well past and the ground
sloped upward to the narrow crevice beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
which the purple night sky lay. He paused
long and listened. The Indian still breathed
regularly. He took a deep breath and went
forward, rising now to his feet and guiding
himself by his hands along the narrowing
walls. Once a stone, disturbed by his tread,
trickled downward with a noise that, to
David, sounded loud enough to wake the
very dead, and it was only by a great effort
of will that he held himself silent there and
did not, in a sudden panic, rush up the rest
of the ascent.</p>

<p>The noise failed to disturb the sleeper. An
Indian, although David did not know it then,
sleeps deeply and is difficult to awake, and to
that fact he doubtless owed the moment’s escape.
After an instant, during which his
heart gradually sank back from his throat,
or seemed to, he went on. By turning sidewise
he had no great difficulty in getting
through the mouth of the crevice, and as his
body brushed the ferns aside a flood of warm
air enveloped him. He crouched motionless
at the entrance and gazed sharply about him
in the confusion of starlight and shadow.</p>

<p>Under the great oaks which were spaced
well apart as though planted by man, the
gloom was deep and impenetrable. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
open spaces the light of a million twinkling
stars made blue pools of dim radiance
wherein David could make out the shapes of
fern patches or the crouching form of a rock.
Somewhere in the higher branches of a tree
a bird twittered sleepily. Afar off an owl
hooted. For the rest only the silence of a hot,
breathless night.</p>

<p>He dared not stay where he was for long
lest the Indian behind should awake and,
seeking him, discover his flight, while to
move forward meant risking recapture in
case the other savage, he who had gone from
the cave earlier in the evening, was on guard
near by. But once well away from his prison,
David believed he would be safe so long as
darkness lasted, and to get away he must risk
the presence of the second savage. Moving
cautiously, testing each step that he took, he
drew himself away from the cavern entrance
and the edge of the shadowed patch beneath
the twisted oak. Monapikot had taught him
the skill that takes one through the woods in
silence, even in the night when the other
senses must make up for sight, and David
caused scarce the swaying of a fern frond as
he made his slow way up the gentle slope,
keeping always to the shadows. Fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
there was little underbrush save patches of
fern and brake, and the ground was soft in
most places with its carpet of dead and rotting
leaves and took his footfalls in silence.
Only once ere he drew nigh the edge of the
oak forest did he make a sound. Then, for
the moment neglecting caution, he set his
foot on a dead twig and it snapped beneath
his weight with the sudden report of a tiny
pistol. He stopped short and crouched back
amongst the black shadows and listened
anxiously. And it was well that he did so,
for when an instant had passed there came
to him the sound of a man’s sleepy yawn
from some spot not many paces away to his
left!</p>

<p>The Indian who had left the cave was
watching from above, watching, perhaps, lest
the English find the tracks they had left and
approach by the open ground!</p>

<p>David, appalled by the narrow margin of
his escape from walking almost straight into
the hands of the enemy, trembled a little as
he sank back on his heels and, scarcely daring
to breathe, stared intently in the direction
of the sound. But the Indian was not visible
to him, although he searched every foot of
gloomy forest above the cave until his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
ached. He had meant to gain the open space
whereby they had approached in the afternoon,
and thus, following, as well as memory
would allow, their trail, come within distant
sight of the palisade and then dip down the
lower slope of the mountain and so reach the
trail to the south. But to do that now he
must pass below the cave and keep to the
forest until well beyond the position of the
sentinel and not until then emerge into the
open. At all hazards, he told himself, he
would put much space between himself and
the Indian there, even if in so doing he lost
all sense of direction. It were better to risk
being lost than recapture.</p>

<p>Acting on this resolve, he slipped around
the great bole of an oak and, keeping it between
him and the spot from whence the
sound of the yawn had come, stole obliquely
down the slope. He made but slow progress,
for in the hush of the woods even the flicking
of a branch or the crunch of an acorn
might arouse the suspicions of the sentinel.
The Indian hearing is very acute and David
had heard amazing instances of it. Slowly,
stealthily he went, and not until a full two
hundred paces had been traversed did he
turn at something less than a right angle to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
his course and make along the hill well below
the cave. The forest was less park-like here,
and saplings, whether of oak or maple he
was not able to say, made travel more difficult.
Low branches must be felt for and
carefully bent aside and as carefully released,
while the earth beneath held more litter of
fallen twigs. Absolute silence was well-nigh
impossible now, and he must trust to the distance
between him and his foe. It was warm
in the forest, warm and humid, and the boy’s
body was soon bathed in perspiration and his
hands sweated so that his grasp on the impeding
branches sometimes slipped and they
whipped his face cruelly and seemed determined
to reveal his presence. But after a
while he breathed more freely and stopped
to rest.</p>

<p>He was very weary now and would have
asked nothing better than to have lain himself
down and slept. But in spite of all his
painful travel, he was still but a short distance
from the cave, and had he failed to
awaken before dawn would of a certainty
been soon found. He reckoned on at least
four hours yet before the light and in those
four hours meant to put as many miles between
him and his Indian guards. That they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
would find him eventually, unless he were
fortunate enough to intercept the English
party on their way back, was certain, for they
would find his tracks in the forest and follow
them as a hound follows the scent of a fox.
His hope, therefore, lay in reaching the Indian
trail to the south while darkness still
held and there lying in wait for his friends.
After that his fate was in the hands of Providence.
If his pursuers came first, his efforts
would have been in vain.</p>

<p>Midges or some other small insects annoyed
him while he rested, and once a
prowling animal, no larger than a small dog,
slunk out of the gloom but a pace away and
startled him with the green fires of its staring
eyes. David moved but his foot and the beast
was gone with a snarl. Up the slope he went
then, from shadow patch to shadow patch,
the trees thinning, and presently the open
ground, rock-strewn, bush-grown, lay before
him in the soft radiance of the stars. He
heaved a deep sigh of relief, for somehow
emerging from the gloom of the forest
seemed like stepping from a dark prison into
freedom. But freedom was not yet his, as he
well knew, and, glancing uneasily to the left
toward where, perhaps a quarter of a mile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
away, the sentinel watched, he made off with
swift steps toward the village, keeping
always to the dark marge of the forest.</p>

<p>He speedily found that haste and quiet
would not agree, for in the gloom he caught
a foot in a tangle of root or vine and measured
his length, exclaiming in spite of himself
when his chin came rudely down on a
stone. Thereafter he went more slowly.
When a half-hour had gone by, a faint flush
of light met his sight. It was, he believed,
the dim yellow glare of a fire in the village
showing above the wall. He went on more
cautiously, the light drawing nearer yet becoming
more faint, as if the fire were dying.
At last he imagined that he could when
crouching to the ground make out the fort
perhaps a quarter of a mile away. He dared
go no closer lest there be guards set outside
the palisade, and so he turned into the forest,
first fixing his gaze on a great star more
brilliant than its fellows and burning with a
redder light that hung in the heavens to the
southeast. He would be guided by that, he
thought. But once in the forest the orb was
instantly lost to him, for here there were
pines and hemlocks growing so closely together
that only now and again could he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
glimpse a bit of the sky between their clustering
branches. Smaller trees and bushes
fought for life beneath the evergreens and
ever he must step aside this way or that until
before long all sense of direction had left him
and he went on in a blackness that had no
relief, trusting to fortune.</p>

<p>That he would know the trail should he
come to it seemed too much to hope for now.
It seemed far more likely that, if his progress,
indeed, led him in the right direction,
he would cross the forest path without
knowledge. And so, when some time had
passed, he became doubly watchful for a
thinning out of the underbrush, and when the
trees seemed less closely set he went no farther
until he had satisfied himself that he had
not reached the trail. It was difficult going
for more reasons than the forest growth, for
fallen trees barred his way and clutched at
his clothing with stark and splintered hands.
He had lost all knowledge of time. It seemed
to him that he had been fighting through the
woods for hours and that daylight must now
be no more than just beyond the world’s rim.
But the thick, velvety blackness continued
and the sky, when infrequently seen, looked
no lighter than before. He grew hopeless and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
despondent, certain that he had fallen into
the easy error of circling, not sure that the
trail was not behind him instead of before.
Weariness took toll of hope. Every muscle
in his body ached and his lungs grew sore.
Pauses for rest, during which he leaned
against a tree or subsided on a fallen log,
fighting for breath and against the languor
that threatened to bring sleep upon him, became
more and more frequent.</p>

<p>In the end he grew to care no whit what
fate befell him if only he might sleep. And
yet some voice at the back of his tired brain
called him awake whenever his eyes closed
and sent him staggering on again. And thus,
at length, what wits remained to him stayed
his steps and sent him feeling about in the
darkness, while hope surged back to his heart.
Behind him were trees, but to the right and
to the left were none until he had twice
stepped forward! Turning to the right he
went cautiously ahead. Nothing impeded
him. More, his feet trod hard earth between
the crawling roots of the pines. He dropped
to his knees and felt the ground. Clean it
was, and the roots that crossed it were worn
with many feet. He had found the trail!</p>

<small>DAVID FACES DEATH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Feeling his way back to where the hanging
branches of a small hemlock promised to
screen him from the trail, David sank to the
ground with a shivering sigh of relief. While
it might be that a long and weary vigil
awaited him, yet to be able to stretch his
aching body and relax his taut muscles was
a blissful thing. When his breathing had
quieted, the sounds of the night, unheard or
unnoted while he journeyed, came to him
eerily: the faint stirrings of small animals,
the scratching noise of a raccoon or hedgehog
clawing his way up a tree-trunk, a brief
flurry in the brush a little way off and the
agonized squeal of some tiny victim surprised
by the slayer, and, suddenly, shudderingly
near, the long-drawn howl of a wolf.</p>

<p>The latter sound brought to the boy a realization
of his unarmed condition. Not even
a knife did he have. He sought within his
reach for some branch that might serve for
a club, but found nothing. After all, it mattered
little, for it was not wolves but Indians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
that he feared, and against them such a
weapon would avail none. As for the wolves,
he had little fear of them, knowing them to
be cowards at heart, attacking only when in
force and having no liking for man. He tried
desperately to keep his eyes open, but they
would close in spite of his efforts, whereupon
his head would drop and he would pull himself
back from the abyss of sleep with a
frightened start. He told himself that, when
he had rested but a little longer, he would
take the trail and travel southward, so placing
more distance between him and his enemies,
walking until daylight should force him again
into concealment. But even as he thought
this, his lids closed again and his chin sank.
This time he did not start into wakefulness.
After a moment his body slid over sidewise,
he gave a long, deep sigh and slept.</p>

<p>When he awoke a saffron light filled the
woods and birds were calling high in the
branches. Dawn had come while he slept,
and his heart sank as he realized that perhaps
his weakness had lost him the reward
of his efforts. It might well be that the English
had passed southward already. In the
stupor that had held him it would have taken
more than the tread of feet on the trail or the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
sound of a voice to alarm him. He peered
forth from his leafy screen and strove to read
the trail, but the well-trod earth told him
nothing. He was at an elbow of the path.
A few paces away in each direction it bent
eastward. Already the leaves of a witch hazel
were pale with the first rays of sunlight that
filtered down through the thick forest. No
longer was it possible for him to travel the
trail, though it might be that by proceeding
slowly and with much caution he could follow
it through the woods. But he was sore
and stiff in every muscle and his hands and
face, whipped and scratched by the branches,
were tender to the touch. He still craved
rest, and yet he knew that should the English
not come soon from the village, their coming
would concern him little, for already the Indians
were doubtless seeking him. For the
first time it occurred to him that, after all, he
had no certain knowledge that his friends
had come for him yesterday. There might be
some other reason for concealing him in the
cave. Perchance an alarm had been brought
to the fort that later had proven false. The
thought dismayed him and for a moment he
contemplated taking the trail boldly and
making what haste his tired limbs would allow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
trusting to luck to meet none who would
question, and so escaping out of the Wachoosett
country ere pursuit reached him. But
second thoughts showed the futility of that
design. Even had he been fresh and untired,
he could not have traveled at a speed great
enough to elude the Indian runners. No, if
the English did not come shortly and he was
still free, he would make his way through the
forest at what haste he might until darkness
and then take advantage of the trail.</p>

<p>Anxiously he waited and watched. Every
stirring of the leaves brought his heart into
his throat. He was parched for water, but
dared not leave the trail to seek it. An hour
passed and hope passed with it, for he was
convinced that his friends, did they mean to
travel back that day, would have made an
early start and ere this have passed his hiding-place.
Either, then, they had not come
yesterday to the village or they had gone by
while he slept. He could have wept with disappointment.
Hunger began to make itself
felt, and he crawled a few yards to where a
black birch grew and broke some twigs from
it and gnawed them. He had but settled in
his place again when his eyes, fixed on the
trail to the north, shouted hope to his heart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Something had moved beyond the leaves
there! An instant later around the bend
came an Indian. Hope vanished and fear
took its place, for the savage was not the vanguard
of the English searching party, but he
who had kept watch last night above the
cave!</p>

<p>Softly yet swiftly he came, his tomahawk
in hand, his head turning from side to side
as he peered with sharp eyes into the forest.
David dropped to the ground, scarce breathing.
Somewhere behind him in the depths of
the wood an owl hooted. The Indian stopped
abruptly and swept the forest with his gaze.
David saw the brown fingers about the haft
of the tomahawk tighten. Again came the
owl’s tremulous call, this time much nearer,
and David’s heart sank sickeningly, for he
knew that the sound came from no owl and
that his brief freedom was near its end. Turning
his head, he looked behind him. At first
there was naught to be seen. Then the branch
of hemlock quivered slightly some dozen paces
distant and beside it something redder than
the bole of the tree showed in the sunlit haze.
The soft padding of moccasined feet drew
his gaze to the trail again, and any lingering
hope he may have had of escaping detection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
died, for the first Indian was coming straight
toward his hiding-place, his black eyes aglitter
and his thin mouth curved in a snarling
grin. They were closing in on him, front
and back, and flight was useless. Yet to be
taken without an effort was not in his mind,
and, leaping to his feet, he brushed past the
branches that had hidden him and sprang
onto the trail. There was a cry from the
savage nearest at hand, but David heeded it
not, but fled fast, his weariness forgotten.</p>

<p>And yet he knew that he could not hope
to elude his pursuers. Even as he sped
around the turn of the trail, he heard the
patter of skin-clad feet behind him and
thought to feel the blow of a thrown tomahawk
each instant. Some sixty paces he
made ere disaster came. Then a tired foot
failed to lift itself above a sprawling root and
the boy crashed forward and went rolling
over and over into the bushes. Jarred
and confused, he strove to regain his feet,
but the first of his foes was beside him. A
snarling copper-hued face glared down at
him and a knife was poised above his heart.</p>

<p>David saw and yielded. “Netop!” he
gasped. The Indian grunted and pressed
the point of the knife closer, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
boy, looking up into the blazing eyes,
read murder in them. What he did then
was done without thought, in the consuming
horror that gripped him. Quickly
lifting a foot, he thrust it at the savage’s
stomach. The latter fell backward with a
grunt of pain, the knife dropped from his
hand, and David, rolling swiftly to one side,
sprang to his feet. But the Indian was up
almost as soon as he. Not heeding the knife
underfoot, he seized his tomahawk and
sprang at the boy, his eyes glaring with pain
and hatred and the lust to kill. David turned
to flee, but a branch had caught at his torn
doublet and now, ere he could wrest himself
away, the Wachoosett was on him. David
saw the tomahawk swing upward and back,
heard the savage’s indrawn breath rattle in
his throat, and knew that the end of all
things on earth had come to him, even as,
instinctively, he threw up an arm to ward
the blow. Then, as the weapon swept down
upon him, a form rushed between, the murderous
arm was grasped and dragged aside,
and the blow ended weakly in air.</p>

<p>The second Indian spoke harshly and
with authority as David, weak with revulsion,
staggered against a tree. What he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
the boy did not know, but it answered, for
the first savage, after a flow of high-pitched,
angry words, yielded grumblingly and moved
aside. David’s rescuer pointed to the trail
sternly and David moved wearily away
toward the village. He realized that only fear
of the sachem had caused the Indian to intervene,
for there was naught of mercy or
gentleness in the brave’s harsh countenance.
When David had gone a few paces, the first
savage passed him swiftly and took the lead,
and so they went for a way, the boy’s limbs
trembling with weariness and his feet dragging.
Then the leader turned from the trail
and entered the forest and the journey became
vastly more difficult. Once, surmounting
a fallen tree, David toppled across it and
rolled to the ground beyond, and would have
stayed there gladly had not the second savage
threatened him with his knife. He staggered
to his feet again and toiled on. Presently
they came to a brook and he made
signs that he was thirsty and they allowed
him to drink. That put new strength into his
body and he made better progress. He believed
that they were taking him back to the
cave, and from that argued that the reason
for his banishment from the village, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
it might be, still existed. But before
long they stopped in a small clearing and
his captors gave him some parched corn to
eat and ate some themselves. Then the Indian
who had led the way disappeared
through the forest toward where David
thought the village must lie. The boy
stretched himself upon the ground and,
watched sourly by the remaining savage,
soon slept the sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>He awoke with a hand tugging at his shirt.
The Indian who had gone away was back,
and when David had got sleepily to his feet
they went on once more, this time toward
the village. But a few minutes brought them
to the edge of the forest, and there, no more
than a half-mile distant, stood the palisade.
And so, tired and discouraged, ragged and
bruised, David came again to the gate in the
fort and back into captivity. Past the Indian
hovels and the snarling dogs, observed incuriously
by the inhabitants, past the great
lodge of the sachem, he was led to his own
wigwam and there, pushed ungently through
the entrance by his captors, he fell to the
ground and knew no more for a long while.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was late afternoon. He
was sore and weary, and, although he had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
mirror to view himself by, he knew that his
face was cut and scratched in many places.
He awoke as one awakes after a bad dream,
the sense of impending misfortune weighting
his spirits. It took him a long moment, however,
to recall the history of the past twenty-four
hours. Memory supplied the record in
fragments and his confused brain found difficulty
in arranging them in their sequence.
When it had done so, a greater depression
seized him. He had lost his chance. His
friends had come and gone. Moreover, Metipom
would doubtless punish him for the attempted
escape. Life looked very drab to
David just then.</p>

<p>His reflections were disturbed by the pat
of moccasined feet on the trampled ground
outside and the entrance was darkened as
the Indian whose duty it was to watch him
and wait upon him entered. John showed
such evident pleasure at seeing the captive
again that David’s spirits momentarily
lightened.</p>

<p>Squatting beside him, John produced his
pipe and hazarded a few words of English.</p>

<p>“How you do?” he asked. “White brother
plenty well?”</p>

<p>“Matchanni,” answered David. “Very
sick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>John shook his head and groaned, thus expressing
his sympathy. Then, ere he realized
what was happening, David found himself
alone again, for the young Indian had
arisen and glided to the door in what seemed
one movement. David sighed. He craved
companionship and even John was better
than no one.</p>

<p>But the Indian was soon back, the palm
of one hand filled with a yellow-brown
grease with which he began to anoint the
boy’s face.</p>

<p>“Much good,” he explained.</p>

<p>“It smells not good,” grumbled David.</p>

<p>But he was glad of the service, and, indeed,
the smarting and burning of the lacerations
ceased as though by magic. Then John
bade him remove his clothes and rubbed the
salve wherever a bruise showed. Afterwards,
at David’s request, he brought water in a
fold of bark. Refreshed, David sought information
of his friends, but the Indian
looked blank and shook his head and David
gave up.</p>

<p>The old squaw appeared with a few live
embers and an armful of fagots and made a
fire, and to escape the smoke, David arose,
not without a groan, and went outside and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
seated himself in the shade of the wigwam.
John took himself off to his own lodge presently.</p>

<p>Many fires were burning and the village
was hazy with the smoke of them. At a little
distance, beside the log barrier, a knot of
older boys were throwing flat stones at a
stake driven into the earth, and their cries
came to him shrilly. The sun was sinking behind
a shoulder of the great hill and its
slanting rays filled the world with a soft
amber radiance. It was a fair and peaceful
scene, yet David had never felt more lonely
and homesick. The ancient squaw came to
the entrance and signed that his food was
ready, and he went in to it, though with little
appetite. As he nibbled at the stewed meat
and beans, he wondered why the sachem had
not summoned him for punishment, and
wondered what the punishment would be.
Yet no summons came, and he went early to
sleep, both because he was still weary and
because he wished to forget his loneliness.
Outside, his jailer sat silent in his blanket
and blew clouds of smoke at the star-sprinkled
sky.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<small>A FRIEND IN STRANGE GUISE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When the succeeding day had passed without
sign from Metipom, David came to the
conclusion that the Indians from whom he
had escaped had refrained from reporting
the incident to the sachem for fear of his
wrath, which was, indeed, the true explanation.
Relieved of the apprehension of punishment,
David’s spirits returned and he gave
thought to practical matters. Next to his imprisonment
the thing that troubled him most
just now was the state of his breeches! None
too new when he had been captured, the
flight through the forest had left them in
tatters. Indeed, they momentarily threatened
to part from him altogether! His shirt
and doublet were likewise in sorry case, but
troubled him less. It seemed to him that
those breeches were past all human aid, even
had he possessed thread and needle wherewith
to mend them. He was still ruefully
deliberating when Sequanawah came to him
bearing the bow that he had promised and
five arrows. Admiration of these put the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
other matter from his mind for the time, yet,
when he had heartily thanked the Indian
and had examined the weapon from tip to
tip, twanging the cord and experimentally
fitting the notch of a stone-tipped arrow to it,
he recalled his quandary and drew Sequanawah’s
attention to them.</p>

<p>The Indian viewed the dilapidated garments
gravely, finally grunting: “No good.
Take um off.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but what shall I put on instead?”
asked David.</p>

<p>Sequanawah suggested a costume like his
own, a loin-cloth wound about his middle,
one end falling in front and one behind. But
David shook his head dubiously, and after a
moment of thought the Indian grunted
again and made off. When he returned he
brought a pair of deer-hide breeches such as
were worn in winter. Where he had obtained
them David did not know, for they were far
too short for Sequanawah, but fitted the boy
well enough. In exchange the Indian took
the discarded breeches, from which he gleefully
cut the two buckles. These, a few days
later, David discovered dangling from a
string of wampum about Sequanawah’s neck.</p>

<p>Each day thereafter David practiced with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
the new bow, Sequanawah teaching. There
was much to learn. First, the cord must be
of the right tension, and, since it was of rawhide,
it seemed never twice the same. Then
the arrow must be chosen with a view to both
distance and conditions of air. With a hard
wind blowing across the course of the flight,
a heavy arrow was needed, and so when the
distance was great; and to that end the
missiles that Sequanawah had provided
varied both in length, thickness, and head.
There was, it appeared, both a right way and
a wrong way to draw the bow; or, rather,
there was one right way and several wrong
ways; and for a time David found only the
latter. At first the boy felt embarrassment
because of the audience that gathered, for all
the old men of the village as well as many of
the younger stood by and discussed each
shot. But before long he became accustomed
to them and minded not their grunts of disapproval
or their guttural words of approbation.
It was soon evidenced to him that his
tutor was one of the tribe’s most skillful
handlers of the bow. This he could tell both
from the marvelous shots that Sequanawah
made and from the evident respect paid him
by the others. He was a stern yet patient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
teacher, and it was not long ere his pupil began
to comport himself creditably and to
earn praise from even his tutor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile David had not ceased wondering
what had taken place during his absence
from the village, and one day, when he had
shot better than ever, he took courage in
hand and put the question to Sequanawah.
Being a counselor, the Indian might well resent
being questioned, as David knew, and it
was not without misgiving that the boy
asked.</p>

<p>Sequanawah was silent a moment, and David
feared that he was offended. But presently
he answered:</p>

<p>“One time come English, make talk with
Great Sachem, have food, have sleep, go
away in morning.”</p>

<p>“Saw you them, Sequanawah?”</p>

<p>“Aye, me see um.”</p>

<p>“Was one a tall man, wide of shoulder,
with a long beard?”</p>

<p>“Maybe so. One was Indian.”</p>

<p>“A Pegan?” asked the boy, thinking of
Monapikot. “A young Indian?”</p>

<p>Sequanawah shook his head. “Old man,
him. Maybe Pegan, maybe Nipmuck.”</p>

<p>“And how many were there who came?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“Four white men, one Indian.”</p>

<p>“Were they—were they seeking me, Sequanawah?”</p>

<p>The Indian’s countenance became blank
and he shook his head. “Me not know.
Maybe so. Maybe hunt.”</p>

<p>No more than that would he tell, but David
had learned enough to know that his
father had sought him, as he had believed.
For the rest of the day he sat beside his
wigwam and conjectured on what lie Woosonametipom
had told the searching party,
who, besides his father, had made the journey,
what conclusion they had come to, and
what further steps they would take. Already
a week had passed and nothing further had
transpired looking to his rescue. He wondered
how fared the war with King Philip
and what things had happened to the southward.
Doubtless by now the chief of the
Wampanoags had been properly subdued.
As to the latter he questioned both John
and Sequanawah, but each professed ignorance.
Twice he held converse with the sachem,
once when Metipom paused where
David was shooting at a mark set against
the palisade wall and once when the chief
summoned him to his lodge and, through an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
interpreter, inquired as to his health and
contentment. On the latter occasion David
had begged to be given his liberty and the
powwow had answered:</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say by and by he give you
guide and send you back safe.”</p>

<p>“And why not now?” David had asked
boldly.</p>

<p>The medicine man shook his head. “Bad
Indians catch um now. Kill um. Not safe
you go now. By and by you go.”</p>

<p>And with that promise he had perforce to
content himself.</p>

<p>Truth it is that David had by now come
to accept his lot with fair grace. Indeed, had
it not been for the thought of the sorrow
which his father was put to and for the uncertainty
as to his ultimate fate, David might
have found real enjoyment with his captors.
There was much to interest him. He was
fast learning their language and fast coming
to a better and more sympathetic understanding
of their ways of life and of thought.
Woosonametipom he could never like, but
there were others for whom he had a friendly
feeling: Sequanawah and John and a certain
gray-locked old man named Quinnapasso
and others. And, he believed, these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
returned his liking. Quinnapasso was very
ancient. Sequanawah said that he was the
oldest Indian in the world. He had been a
famous warrior and hunter and was still
greatly respected for his wisdom and still
held his place in Metipom’s council. In spite
of his age and feebleness of body, his eyes
were still bright and clear and his trembling
hands had not lost their cunning. All day
long he sat at the entrance of his wigwam
and fashioned pipes of black and red and
gray stone, and thither David frequently
went and, sitting beside him, talked a little
with him in Nipmuck and watched the skillful
way in which he chiseled and drilled the
blocks of porphyry and sandstone brought
to him by his grand-daughter. Quinnapasso’s
pipes were much sought and brought
him many skins and much wampum and
food. David became the recipient of one,
which he was loath to take until he saw that
his hesitation was wounding the old man.
Whereupon he thanked Quinnapasso in halting
Nipmuck and the pipe-maker nodded
and grinned and mumbled through toothless
gums.</p>

<p>As August approached, the village became
more busy. The women set out in parties of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
ten or a dozen in the morning and returned
at night well laden with fish which the next
day was dried and cured on platforms of
boughs beneath which fires of green wood
burned. The squaws also gathered flags for
the later weaving of mats and baskets. The
mats were used more often than skins for
the walls of their houses. Many other uses
were found for them, and they were dyed by
the women in several colors. Corn was beginning
to tassel and the squashes—planted
wherever a pocket of soil allowed the dropping
of the queer flat seeds—showed great
yellow blossoms. There was much work for
the women, to whom fell what cultivation
was done in the straggling garden patches.
Also, it became their duty to see that pits
were dug for the autumn storing of the corn,
and to line them well with bark. The men,
it seemed to David, worked not at all, unless
hunting and trapping might be called labor.
Even fishing they left to the squaws. Occasionally
one could be found hammering an
ornament from a piece of metal, or, maybe,
fashioning arrows or bows or spears. As for
wampumpeag, or wampum as the English
called it, it seemed that the Wachoosetts
made none themselves, but bartered for it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
with other tribes. As this money was made
from seashells—the word wampumpeag
signifying a mussel in the Iroquois language—it
was doubtlessly difficult for tribes living
inland to secure material to work with.
Nevertheless David saw much of it and many
marvelous examples of the curious and even
beautiful shapes into which it was wrought:
those of birds and animals and flowers. In
color it was usually black or white, the black
being of slightly more value, but there were
also many shades between; purple, blue,
brown, yellow, and pink. By combining the
various colors and shades the beads were
often made into wonderful patterns on belts,
necklaces, bracelets, ear-links, and other ornaments.
Woosonametipom when royally
bedecked wore a head-dress of wampum as
well as a broad and long girdle which went
twice about his body and ended in a fringe
of deer-hair dyed red.</p>

<p>When the second week of David’s captivity
had merged into a third, the village was
one morning aroused from its placidness by
the appearance of three strange Indians.
Their approach had been signalled from
afar, and by the time they were crossing the
open space between forest and village many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of the male inhabitants had gathered to
greet them. The sun was yet but a scant
five hours above the horizon, but the heat
was already intolerable and the rocky slope
shimmered and glared as the naked strangers
drew near. All were young men and all were
armed and painted most hideously. One, of
the three the more heavy of build, carried
upon his back a bundle wrapped in rush matting.
His companions, taller and slimmer,
bore only their weapons and food pouches.
Woosonametipom, attended by several of his
counselors, and himself decked in his “royalty”
of embroidered blanket and wampum
head-dress and girdle, awaited the visitors at
the gate. When the strangers were a dozen
paces distant they paused and gave salutation.
The Wachoosetts returned it, whereupon
one of the strangers stepped forward
and spoke at length, addressing his remarks
to the sachem, but seeming to include all his
hearers. He was listened to in absolute
silence. David, pressing toward the gate behind
the throng of young men and old,
women and children, who had gathered just
inside it, understood enough of the brave’s
talk to know that he was but declaiming the
usual message of greeting from one chief to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
another, a message filled with compliments
to the hearer’s wisdom and courage and nobility.
Yet one word that was twice spoken
produced each time a ripple of movement
from the throng and, or so David felt, a current
of excitement. That word was Pometacom.</p>

<p>From where he stood, well within the palisade,
David caught but uncertain glimpses of
the visitors between the heads of the group
about him, for the gateway was narrow and
the strangers stood a little to one side. Yet
at times a painted visage moved into his sight
for a fleeting instant and aroused a sense
of familiarity. The countenance seemed
strange and yet dimly known. Above it a
glistening scalp-lock, reeking with oil, was
wound with crimson cloth and adorned with
yellow and blue feathers. A rude painting
of a duck was done in white on the man’s
forehead and each cheek held a crude and
uncertain design in the same pigment, while
across the bridge of the nose and beneath the
eyes ran two stripes. In his ears were bone
pendants, carved to strange shapes. He was
tall and straight and well-muscled, and bore
himself with an air of authority that well
fitted him. All this David could not see at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the moment. Had he done so doubtless
the stirrings of memory would have been
stronger.</p>

<p>Presently the spokesman, an Indian of no
less stature than he who had caused David’s
perplexity, but with flatter features and less
grace of carriage, ended his discourse. A
moment of silence followed. Then Metipom
began to speak. The sachem had a deep and
resonant voice and used it eloquently. Also
he used it at much length, and David felt
that his body was shriveling in the heat ere
the sachem ended and the throng within the
gate fell back. David found himself in the
front of the throng when Metipom and his
counselors stalked back through the entrance,
followed by the visitors, and hence
was within arm’s reach of the latter as they
passed him. First came he who had spoken,
the perspiration standing in beads upon the
oiled surface of his body, his eyes straight
ahead, a sort of contemptuous dignity upon
him. The shorter and heavier Indian followed
upon his heels, a sly-eyed, long-headed
youth who saw much without seeming to
turn his gaze. Behind him, lithe with the
easy grace of a panther, came the third messenger.
He, too, following the custom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
his people, forbore to glance to left or right,
since all semblance of curiosity was considered
discourteous, until, being close upon
David, he for an instant only shot a look
straight into the boy’s eyes. As brief as it
was, it said much, for eyes and nostrils
dilated warningly, and David, with a gasp
he could not smother, recognized beneath
the painted lines and symbols the countenance
of Monapikot!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<small>EMISSARIES FROM KING PHILIP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A moment later he was doubting his senses.
The visitors had disappeared into the
sachem’s wigwam and the villagers had
crowded in behind them or clustered about
the doorway, and David was alone in the hot
glare of the sun. Bewilderedly he passed the
edge of the throng. From within the lodge
came the murmur of a voice. Outside the
crowd was talking in low tones. A perceptible
atmosphere of excitement had pervaded
the village. But David, seeking his own wigwam,
gave little thought to that. If the Indian
was, indeed, Pikot, why was he there,
an emissary of the murderous King Philip?
Had it come to pass, as Obid had long predicted,
that Eliot’s Indians had forgot their
teachings and returned to savagery? David
could believe it of some, but never of Pikot!
Besides, the look his friend had given him
had said, “Caution!” If Pikot had really
joined with Philip, he would have cared little
whether David recognized him. What the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
look had conveyed to the boy was: “I am
Pikot, your friend, but you must not know
me. Whatever happens, we are strangers.
Trust me!” David drew a deep breath and
felt a lightening of the heart. Whatever
Pikot’s secret might be, it was not a shameful
one, he decided, and he would trust him.
Indeed, it might well be that Straight Arrow
was but playing a part in order to rescue
his old friend. Perchance he had been dispatched
hither by the Council at Boston.
And yet, in spite of his resolve to be trustful,
David revolted at the recollection of Pikot
oiled and painted and bedecked for the war-path
and serving as a messenger for that outlaw,
Philip of Mount Hope.</p>

<p>Then a new thought came to him. Was it
not possible that the embassy from Philip
was but a pretense, a means of entering the
Wachoosett village as friends? Maybe not
only Pikot, but the two Indians with him,
were there for no other purpose than to rescue
him, David, from Metipom. And yet the
boy’s knowledge of the Indians told him beyond
doubt that neither of Pikot’s companions
was Nipmuck, but, unless he was much
mistaken, of King Philip’s own tribe.</p>

<p>His further ponderings were interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
by a darkening of the entrance, and John
entered.</p>

<p>“You come,” he said. “Great Sachem
say it.”</p>

<p>Wondering, David followed John to the
big wigwam. Shouldering his way through
the throng without, John led David through
the door and into the softer twilight of the
lodge. Within was an unusual scene. Every
available foot of space was occupied save in
the very center, where, surrounded by all his
counselors, the sachem sat with the three
messengers from King Philip before him.
Around this group, packed like fish in a hogshead,
were the men of the village, or so many
of them as were fortunate enough to enter.
The sachem’s big green stone pipe had been
smoked by the visitors and the chief and
was now passing from hand to hand amongst
the counselors. There was little talk going
on, although occasionally Metipom addressed
a question or a word to the guests and was
briefly answered. David’s advent excited no
attention, and, at a sign from John, he
squatted at the edge of the circle. Through
the smoke-hole above, the sun sent a long
wand of golden radiance into the wigwam
in which the blue haze of tobacco smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
wreathed and eddied. The place was intolerably
hot and close. As he took his seat,
David glanced surreptitiously at Monapikot.
The Pegan was silent and straight and motionless,
and if he knew of David’s entrance
he made no sign. Between the guests
and the sachem, on the rush mats there, lay
the bundle they had brought. For some reason
David’s eyes returned to it again and
again in a fascination he could not have explained.
After that first glance he avoided
looking at Pikot lest sharp eyes should read
his thoughts. At a little distance, through
the smoke haze, he saw Sequanawah, and,
in the background, the ancient Quinnapasso,
the latter apparently taking advantage of the
ceremonial silence to snatch a few winks of
sleep. David, wondering for what reason he
had been summoned, waited seemingly unperturbed,
but secretly much concerned.</p>

<p>At last the peace pipe completed its journey
and was returned to the sachem, who
laid it carefully on the floor at his feet. Then
he pointed to the spokesman of the embassy.
“You talk,” he said.</p>

<p>Obediently the Indian arose, cast a slow
look about the wigwam, and then, facing the
sachem, spoke. Much of what he said was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
well beyond David’s understanding, for not
only did he speak the native language, but
he used many words having no place in the
Nipmuck tongue. Nevertheless, the boy
comprehended the tenor of what he said.</p>

<p>The spokesman’s name was Wissataumkin,
and he proclaimed himself a Narragansett
and one who stood close to his sachem,
Quananchett, son of Miantunnomoh. With
him, he said, were Tamanso, son of Nowapowett,
and nephew of King Philip, and
Wompatannawa, a Niantic captain. At the
latter name he indicated Monapikot. The
Great Sachem, King Philip, had sent them
to tell his brothers, the Wachoosett people,
how went his war against the English and
for what reasons that war was being waged.
Thereupon Wissataumkin told of Philip’s
grievances against the colonists, and a very
strong case indeed did he make. He accused
the English of disregarding written treaties
and of violating spoken promises. He referred
to the execution of Poggapanossoo,
otherwise Tobias, Philip’s counselor, and
two others for the killing of John Sassamon.
He said that since Philip had made war the
English had preyed on women and children,
arresting all they could lay hands on and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
taking them into captivity: and that unless
their hand was stayed they would send them
across the great water as slaves. Then he
told of battles fought; of how Philip had
met with and defeated many Englishmen
at Pocasset, of the battle in the swamp beside
the Taunton River where countless of
the enemy had been slain, of his attack on
Mendon and the ambush at Quaboag. According
to the narrator, King Philip had been
everywhere victorious and the English were
in terror and in all places falling back on
their forts. Before the leaves were off the
trees, declared Wissataumkin, not one white
man would be left. The Narragansetts and
the Nipmucks to the south had joined with
the Great Sachem Philip. Woosonametipom
and his people were also Nipmucks, and now
Philip bade them choose whether they would
fight with him or against him. Soon the war
would come to their country, and those who
were not with Philip would be considered
against him. What word should he carry
back to his chief?</p>

<p>When Wissataumkin had ceased, Metipom,
who had listened gravely and in silence,
spoke. “What you say may be true, O Wissataumkin,
but we have heard other tales.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
We have heard that the English have killed
many of Philip’s warriors and taken many
prisoners. We care little for the English,
although we have long remained at peace
with them. Nor is Philip’s quarrel our quarrel
unless we make it so. We go not to war
at any man’s ordering. Yet it seems that
our people have been patient under many
wrongs inflicted by these white-faces and it
may be that, as you have said, the time has
come to drive them forth from our fields and
forests, that peace and prosperity may return
once more to us. I, too, have suffered wrong,
for these same English did seize my son,
Nausauwah, for no cause and do now hold
him prisoner in their town of Boston. And
yet to take up Philip’s quarrel may not be
wise, for the English fight with guns and we
have but few, and against powder and lead
the arrow is weak. I would take counsel, my
brothers. By sunset you shall have my
answer. Until then my house is yours, and
all that is mine is for you to partake of.”</p>

<p>“I hear, O Sachem,” answered Wissataumkin.
“May your council be wise. As
to that Philip’s warriors have been killed
and made prisoners, why, that is but an English
lie. None dare stand but a moment’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
time against him. In battle his enemies fall
before him like rushes before the knife. His
wigwams are decked with the heads of the
foes. For token, O Woosonametipom, he
sends you these gifts.”</p>

<p>He gestured to Tamanso and the latter
drew his knife from his belt and cut the lashings
about the bundle that lay before him.
Slowly, dramatically, he unrolled the rush
matting while all within the wigwam craned
their heads to see. And then, gruesome and
horrid, there lay to the gaze two dried and
withered human heads.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<small>THE SACHEM DECIDES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A sibilant sound, the indrawing of many
breaths, passed about the wigwam. David,
after a first horrified look at the awful trophies,
closed his eyes against the sight, faint
and sick. For an instant the scene rocked
and swayed about him and he stretched forth
a groping hand for support. Then the tremor
passed and a great and suffocating anger
swelled within him, and he opened his eyes
again to see Metipom leaning forward above
the heads, his countenance set in a grim and
baleful smile. Wissataumkin, on his feet,
looked down triumphantly. The flat-faced
Tamanso had the air of a conjuror after a
successful trick. Him they called Wompatannawa,
alone of the three emissaries,
showed no emotion. Very straight he sat, his
gaze fixed levelly over the heads of the
throng.</p>

<p>At sight of Monapikot, David’s wrath
overflowed and he sprang to his feet, one outstretched
hand pointing accusingly at the
Pegan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“Traitor and renegade!” he cried.
“This is your gratitude, then, this your return
for our trust and friendship! Mayhap
those be fruit of your treachery, Monapikot!
Which of your benefactors have you slain?
Wompatannawa you call yourself? Hear a
fitter name: Murderer! You who—”</p>

<p>Two braves beside him, at a sign from
Metipom, seized him and bore him, struggling,
to the ground. His torrent of anger
ceased only when a knife touched his throat,
and then, trembling, hot tears in his eyes,
he gave in.</p>

<p>“You no talk,” said one of the Indians
grimly.</p>

<p>David swallowed hard, nodded, and, after
a moment, muttered, “Winnet.” When he
looked, the sachem was addressing Monapikot.
None, it seemed, had heeded his outburst.
Perhaps for the few who knew any
English, save Monapikot, his words had
flowed too fast to be understood. When the
pounding of blood in his head would allow,
he strove to hear what the Pegan was saying
to Metipom, for the former had arisen to
his feet and was speaking in Nipmuck.</p>

<p>“I know him not, Woosonametipom, nor
ever saw him. Nor do I know how it happens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
that an Englishman’s cub is present at this
conference. Where I come from, Great Sachem,
we do not invite the enemy to our
councils.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur about the wigwam,
and Metipom scowled. “Since when, O
Wompatannawa, have the Niantic people,
who no longer make laws of their own, but
follow the mandates of the Narragansetts as
a dog follows its master, begun to teach wisdom
to others?” he asked haughtily.</p>

<p>“The dog that is faithful bites its master’s
enemies, O Sachem,” replied the Pegan
meaningly.</p>

<p>“And the dog who knows no master
minds his own affairs,” said Metipom. “My
people eat from no one’s hand, O Young
Man Wise Beyond Your Years. Nor do
they come or go at any’s bidding. The
Wachoosetts owe no allegiance to Philip.
Nor do they bite without cause. If there be
cause now we shall see.” He turned to Wissataumkin.
“Food shall be prepared for you.
May it do you much good. At sunset you
shall have my answer.”</p>

<p>The emissaries from Philip arose and went
out and all save the counselors followed.
David, too, would have departed, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
sachem ordered him stayed, and presently
the powwow was making talk with him.</p>

<p>“Great Sachem say what for you speak
Niantic man?” he asked. “You know um
maybe?”</p>

<p>David hesitated. Then: “I do not know
him. Anger caused me to speak.”</p>

<p>“What for you angry with him, David?”</p>

<p>David pointed at the withered heads at
his feet. “Those, O Wise Powwow, are the
heads of my people. This man Wompatannawa
is my enemy. Does not one feel anger
at his enemy?”</p>

<p>The medicine man translated the reply to
the sachem, and the latter grunted. Then:</p>

<p>“These men say King Philip makes war
on the English and everywhere defeats um.
Say they run away like foxes before dogs.
What you think?”</p>

<p>“I think they lie. Say to the Great Sachem
that the English do not run from their
enemies. They stand and fight. If they are
killed, they are killed. But they do not retreat.
Therefore the tale these men have
told is false to that extent. And if they lie
of one thing, why not of all? Before I was
brought here the Nipmucks and the Narragansetts
had given their word to the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
to remain their friends.” David hoped that
this was true, but did not know it. “It may
be that a few have dishonored that promise,
but a few only. Say to the Great Sachem that
there can be but one outcome of a war between
the English and the Indians, and that
when, as it will be, the English are victorious,
then much trouble will come for all who have
shown themselves their enemies. The English
have many guns that shoot farther than
an arrow can fly, and many horses wherewith
they can outdistance the fleetest runner.
They are many and the Indians few.
If the Wachoosetts take arms against them,
many years of sorrow will follow.”</p>

<p>During David’s words Metipom kept his
eyes on the boy’s face as though seeking to
read what thoughts lay behind it. And when
the powwow had again translated, the sachem
was silent a moment, his gaze on the
ghastly tokens before him. Finally he raised
his eyes to David and pointed at the heads.</p>

<p>“What of those?” he asked in his own
tongue.</p>

<p>“I have not said, O Sachem, that none of
my countrymen have been killed. Doubtless
a few have fallen and a few are prisoners.
But said these messengers from Philip how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
many Indians have been killed? My hand
has two sides, and so has every tale.”</p>

<p>Metipom thrust his lower lip forth, shot a
calculating glance at David and nodded. So,
too, did some of the counselors: and one
spoke. It was the aged Quinnapasso.</p>

<p>“The White Boy talks wise talk,” he
quavered. “If Philip conquers, why does he
seek our help, Woosonametipom?”</p>

<p>At that many grunted and several spoke
together until the sachem bade them be
silent. “Tell him to be gone,” he said, pointing
at David. “Tell him we will weigh what
he has said.”</p>

<p>Outside, David drew a long breath of relief,
thankful to be away from the mournful
sight of Philip’s tokens. As he sought his
wigwam, he strove to solve the puzzling mystery
of Monapikot’s apparent defection.
Now that his spasm of anger had passed,
something of his former belief in his friend
returned. After all, the heads proved nothing
one way or another. And although Pikot’s
words to Metipom had seemed to encourage
the sachem to take sides with Philip, yet it
might be that they had been meant to have
the other effect, to arouse in him a spirit of
obstinacy. Metipom was proud and self-willed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
and might well resent dictation. And
Pikot’s bearing had warmed David’s old affection
as, straight and dignified and proudly
contemptuous, he had dared the sachem’s
anger. In the wigwam David threw himself
on his bed of skins and, with his hands beneath
his head, gazed at the hot, sun-smitten
roof above him and tried to find an answer
to the riddle. After a while the old squaw
pattered in and would have made a fire, but
David, far from hungry, drove her forth,
chattering, into the sunlight.</p>

<p>The heat put him to sleep at last, and when
he awoke an hour or more later John was
squatting beside him, his pipe between his
lips. David lay a minute and watched the
Indian’s face and wondered what thoughts
were passing behind that mask-like countenance.
Presently, sighing for weariness of
the heat, David drew the Indian’s regard,
and the latter turned his grave eyes toward
the boy.</p>

<p>“Much hot,” he grunted.</p>

<p>“Aye, John. Have Philip’s messengers
departed yet?”</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head and pointed
his pipe-stem toward the sky. “Sun um
high. No go so. Bimeby.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>“But—what time of the day is it?”
asked David perplexedly. “I thought—”
His gaze encountered the glare outside the
entrance and he remembered and groaned.
“’Tis yet but early afternoon,” he said.
“Hast heard what decision Metipom and his
council will reach?”</p>

<p>John could not comprehend that and David
turned it into his halting Nipmuck.</p>

<p>Then: “Nay,” answered John, “they still
talk. Their voices sound like the cawing of
many crows in the spring. The young men
say one thing and the old men another, and
the Great Sachem sits and smokes his pipe
and listens.”</p>

<p>“What say the young men, brother?”</p>

<p>John cast a quick glance from the corners
of his half-shut eyes and his lips drew back
at their corners in a snarling grin. “War!”
he answered.</p>

<p>“Against the English?” David laughed
shortly. “’Tis evident that their choice is
also yours, O Blind One.”</p>

<p>John muttered words that the other could
not catch. Then: “I am not so blind but
that I can see my enemy,” he answered,
frowning.</p>

<p>“The fox who fled from the sound ran into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
the trap. What you think is an enemy is
but a noise made by King Philip.”</p>

<p>“He is a great warrior and a sachem of
much wisdom.”</p>

<p>“A great warrior he may be,” said David,
“but his wisdom is that of a gnat.”</p>

<p>John scowled and muttered.</p>

<p>“Philip has followed the advice of a few
malcontents, and now, having declared war
and finding his mistake, he seeks help of the
great Metipom. The fox who fell into the
pitfall called on the bear to help him. So
the bear jumped into the hole and the fox
climbed out on his back. Whereupon the
bear called to him and asked: ‘And in what
manner do I escape, Master Fox?’ And the
fox answered: ‘Why, that Brother Bear, is
a thing concerns me not. I bid you good-day!’”</p>

<p>“You speak for your people,” grumbled
John. “I speak for mine. When the wind
blows two ways there is only dust.”</p>

<p>“Until one wind becomes the stronger, O
Brother. Then the dust vanishes and wise
counsel prevails.”</p>

<p>The Wachoosett grunted. “My brother
has many words,” he replied dryly, and relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>Presently the heat became intolerable
within the wigwam, and David fared forth.
About one of the lodges near the center of
the village many men were gathered, and
amongst them David saw, as he drew near,
Pikot and his two companions. They sat a
little apart, each smoking gravely, and taking
no part in the talk that was going on.
Most of those in the gathering were younger
men, although here and there one beyond
fighting age hearkened to the discussion.
David paused a little from the edge of the
throng and sought to catch Pikot’s eye, but
while the Pegan must have been aware of
his presence he never so much as glanced the
boy’s way, and after a moment, since the
Indians began to regard him with disfavor,
he went on.</p>

<p>From within the big wigwam of the sachem
came the sound of a voice, quavering,
monotonous, and David recognized it for
the voice of Quinnapasso. As the boy passed
beyond, the voice died away and in its place
came the deeper speech of another.</p>

<p>David found a place of shade near the
gate of the palisade and stretched himself
down, and after a moment one of the yellow
village dogs crept toward him, wagging an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
ingratiating tail, and the boy for loneliness
called the sorry creature to him and patted
him, at which the dog, surprised as delighted
with such uncommon kindness, licked his
hand and curled up against his body.</p>

<p>Slowly the sun neared the western slope
of the hill and the heat diminished, and David
thought of food. The council yet continued
and the gathering near by was larger
than before, with many squaws standing
about the fringe. Finding John, David made
known his desire for food, and then seated
himself in the shade of the lodge to await
the arrival of the old crone. And while he
sat there there came a stirring in the village
and a youth shouted shrilly, and the cry
was taken up by others. Then an Indian
drum began to sound, and David, having
arisen to look, saw a dozen or more of the
younger men stepping about in a wide circle
in ridiculous postures while the older men
stood by applauding with shouts and gestures.
But the women had hurried to their
houses, and now David saw them dragging
their goods outside the doors. The drum
went on monotonously and the boys, prancing
and chanting in high voices, formed in
line and went weaving in and out between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
wigwams. David did not need the triumph
in John’s face to tell him what decision the
sachem and his counselors had arrived at.
The Indian came striding toward him
swiftly, his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“The Great Sachem has spoken,” he announced
proudly. “We make war on your
people, O White Brother.”</p>

<p>David nodded indifferently. Then: “I
am sorry,” he said. “The Fox has had his
way.”</p>

<p>When John had gone again and the old
squaw was busied over David’s meal, Sequanawah
came. Silently he seated himself
near by and dropped tobacco into his pipe.
When it was lighted and drawing he asked
soberly: “My brother has heard?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Sequanawah.”</p>

<p>The Indian smoked for a long moment.
At last: “Battle is good,” he went on.
“Peace, too, is good. I do not know.”</p>

<p>“I wish your sachem had decided otherwise,”
said David sadly. “The English are
too strong, Sequanawah, and when the war
is past your tribe will suffer with the rest.
I am sorry.”</p>

<p>Sequanawah bowed. “My brother speaks
what he believes is truth. He may be right.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
The medicine men say not so. Their omens
foretell great victories, David.”</p>

<p>“That we shall see, O Sequanawah. But
I grieve that this thing must come between
my brother and me.”</p>

<p>The Wachoosett bowed again and looked
troubled. “Sequanawah sorrows, too, O David.
His heart is sad.” He emptied his pipe
and arose. “Farewell, brother.”</p>

<p>“So soon, Sequanawah? You take the
trail to-night?”</p>

<p>“I know not at what hour, but ere morning
I shall be gone. Farewell.”</p>

<p>Sequanawah turned and departed against
the lingering glow of the sunset and passed
from David’s sight. The old squaw grumbled
that his food was ready and he bade her
bring it forth to him there. While he ate,
the preparations for leaving went forward
busily, and presently, as twilight came, a
great fire flared before the sachem’s lodge
and more drums beat, and painted braves,
feathered and grotesque in the dancing light
of the flames, circled and howled and groaned
and shook their spears to the purpling, star-pricked
sky.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<small>MONAPIKOT’S MESSAGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Far into the night the war-dance continued.
As men tired and dropped from the circle
that revolved about the leaping fire, others
took their places. Squaws, seated together
near at hand, cried their warriors on to fresh
exertions. Old men nodded and watched and
grunted approval, their rheumy eyes brightening
again with memories. Medicine men,
wearing their choicest ornaments, hideously
besmeared from forehead to ankle, capered
and chanted like evil things seen in a dream.
And beneath the songs and wild cries, the
steady, unvarying <em>tum-tum-tum</em> of the
drums sounded as sounds the beat of the
waves under the tumult of the tempest.</p>

<p>David watched from afar. He had no
taste for such ceremonies, nor any sympathy.
He had grown to appreciate many attributes
of the Indians; their bravery and hardihood,
their honesty in their dealings with each
other, their faithfulness in friendship; but
this childish orgy by which they lashed themselves
to a frenzy of bloodthirstiness, this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
recitation of boastful legends and vain
threatenings, left him cold. To the Anglo-Saxon
mind there was something akin to
lunacy in such doings.</p>

<p>David wondered if Monapikot and his
two unpleasing companions had left on their
homeward journey. It seemed likely, although
once, near the middle of the evening,
he had thought that he had glimpsed the tall,
straight form of the Pegan against the firelight.
That Pikot should go without a few
words of speech with him seemed strange.
It would not have been impossible for the
Indian to have spoken briefly under some
pretext, and David felt resentful and sad because
he had not done so. To-night it became
easy once more to believe that his old
friend had indeed turned traitor.</p>

<p>John had deserted his charge utterly and
was prancing and bending and howling
about the fire. Sequanawah had vanished,
but whether he had left the village David
did not know. Thoughts of escape came to
him and he weighed the chances of success.
Many times he had wondered whether by
scaling the palisade wall he could evade the
watchfulness of the sentries. Reaching the
top of the wall would be no easy feat, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
the smooth, peeled logs that formed it were
a good twelve feet in height. Yet he had observed
places where, he thought, he might
take advantage of crevice and protrusion
with hands and feet and so win the summit.
Beyond the palisade lay a dry ditch of no
great consequence. It would but increase
his drop by another two or three feet. Surmounting
the wall was, he believed, possible
under favoring circumstances such as at
present pertained, but the question was what
would happen afterwards. He had learned
long since that by night the village was well
guarded. And he knew, too, that Metipom
had ordained his death if captured outside
the palisade. To-night it might be that, with
every man of fighting age apparently taking
part in the dance, the sentries had been
withdrawn, but it would not do to count too
much on that. On the other hand, the decision
for war might well have caused them to
increase their vigilance. In any case, David
decided, action was best delayed until the
village had quieted for the night and the exhausted
Indians slept. A new moon hung
in the western sky, giving a faint radiance
where the ruddy light of the flames failed.
In two hours, maybe, or three at the most,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
the moon would be below the elbow of the
mountain and his chance of getting away
unseen would be better.</p>

<p>After a while he lay down where he was,
against the side of the wigwam, resolved to
snatch what sleep he might before the time
for action came, if come it should. For a
time he lay and watched the silver stars and
strove to close his ears to the throbbing of
the drums and the howling of the Indians.
Gradually sleep settled over his tired body
and his breathing grew deep and slow. An
hour of the hot, breathless night passed.
Occasionally the sleeper stirred or moaned,
but he did not wake. And so it was that he
did not hear the faint, stealthy movements
that might have attracted his attention had
he been awake. From behind the wigwam
they came, sounds like the soft squirming of
a serpent across the tufts of sun-parched
grass and through the low patches of briars,
sounds no louder than a weasel might have
made, and that, subdued by the noise of the
drums and the dancers, might well have escaped
any save the keenest ears. Behind the
wigwam, away from the dancing, flickering
light of the fire, the darkness was not black,
but yet was deep enough to render uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
the shadow that lay upon the ground there
and moved slowly nearer and nearer. Then,
presently, the moving shadow merged with
that of the lodge and the faint sounds ceased.</p>

<p>David came slowly awake, floating to consciousness
across the margin of sleep as a
swimmer floats to shore. Something had
summoned him, but he knew not what.
Above the stars still twinkled in a sky that
was like a close-hanging curtain of warm
purple-black velvet. The slender moon had
halved the distance to the dark fringe of
forest and crags that marked the edge of the
mountain. But the uncanny beat of the
drums and thud of feet and howling of voices
still went on. David blinked and yawned,
vaguely disturbed, and then listened acutely.
From the half-darkness came a sibilant
voice:</p>

<p>“<em>David!</em>”</p>

<p>With a quick leap of his pulse the boy
answered:</p>

<p>“I am here! Who speaks my name?”</p>

<p>“Monapikot.”</p>

<p>“Monapikot!” There was no disguising
the gladness he felt.</p>

<p>“Aye, Noawama. Speak softly. Are you
outside?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, Straight Arrow. And you? I do
not see you.”</p>

<p>“I, too. Go inside the wigwam and lie
close to the wall at its back and farthest
from the fire. I have many things to say
and there is little time.”</p>

<p>David obeyed. At the nearer lodge an
elderly squaw sat motionless by the doorway,
a child slumbering against her knees.
None others were near. Placing himself so
that his lips were close to the rancid-smelling
skins of the wigwam, David said: “I am
here, Pikot.”</p>

<p>“Good,” replied the other softly. “Listen
well, David. When the moon is behind the
hill we start our journey back to the southward,
and ere that much must be said. You
did well to seem not to know me when I
came, but what happened after was child’s
foolishness, David, and might have cost me
my life.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said David humbly. “And
yet, my friend, I scarce knew what to think.
Nor do I yet.” He paused, seeking to ask a
question and yet at a loss for words to clothe
it in. At last: “Is—is all well?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“Aye. I bring you greetings from your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
father. In this way matters stand, David.
The Wachoosett sachem demands the release
of his son as the price of your return, but so
skillfully has he spoken that none dare say
for certain that he holds you captive. It is,
he says, Manitou who will bring you back
safe to your home so soon as he is pleased
by the release of Nausauwah. He talked
slyly of knowing your place of captivity by
reason of a vision, and so well did he play the
fox that your father and Master Vernham
returned not knowing whether he told the
truth or not.”</p>

<p>“Then my father did come for me,
Pikot?” asked David eagerly.</p>

<p>“Aye, with Master William Vernham and
Obid, the servant, and Captain Consadine,
of the Military at Newtowne.”</p>

<p>“And an Indian, Pikot. Was it you?”</p>

<p>“Nay; I was to the south and knew
naught of your going until later. The guide
was Tanopet.”</p>

<p>“Tanopet!”</p>

<p>“Aye. But we waste time that stands not
still. Your father and Master Vernham and
others have sought to secure the release of
Nausauwah, but with no avail. Promises
have been made, but naught is done. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
war against Philip engages much attention
and all else, it seems, must wait. But if
they do not give the Indian his freedom,
neither do they bring him to trial, and until
then you are safe, David.”</p>

<p>“Safe! Then you did not come to rescue
me, Pikot?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. Other duties lie before me,
Noawama, that I cannot tell of. But keep a
brave heart and a still tongue. Soon I will
come again.”</p>

<p>“My father? And Obid?”</p>

<p>“Well, David. Your father troubles over
your prisonment and that there is naught
he can yet do to end it. But now that the
Wachoosetts go upon the war-path, that is
changed, and fear of offending them will no
longer hold him back. While Woosonametipom
was still at peace with the English, the
Council at Boston would not allow aught
that might seem unfriendly.”</p>

<p>“But how comes it that you are here on
such a strange mission, Straight Arrow? I
never thought to see you inciting our enemies
against us. If you came not to seek
me, I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Said I that I did not come seeking you,
David? Nay, I but said that not yet could I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
deliver you from the sachem. Larger matters
come first. As for the company I keep,
heed it not. Who visits the wolf must wear
fur. Trust me, Noawama, as your people
do.”</p>

<p>“I do trust you, Straight Arrow. Tell me
how goes the war with King Philip?”</p>

<p>“Well and ill. The Narragansetts have
joined with him, as have a few of the Nipmucks
living to the south, but the Mohegans
have sent warriors to our aid led by Oneko,
son of Uncas. Of late Philip was driven
into a swamp beside the Taunton River and,
had the English attacked with skill as well
as bravery and pressed close, he would have
been there and then destroyed. But, seeking
to starve him out, they withdrew all but a
few soldiers, and he soon found canoes and
slipped away across the river and into the
Nipmuck country where he daily gathers
more warriors to his cause.”</p>

<p>“It would seem that some one blundered,”
mused David.</p>

<p>“Aye,” agreed Pikot grimly. “And the
blunder may cost dear, for now Philip no
longer has the sea at his back, but may come
and go as he chooses, with the forests to
lurk in. But it grows late, Noawama, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
must be away. Keep a brave heart and put
your trust in God.”</p>

<p>“And you will come soon again, Straight
Arrow?”</p>

<p>“Aye, but when I know not. Perchance
some day when on the trail you will find me
beside you. Then make no sign, but let believe
that we are strangers, David.”</p>

<p>“On the trail said you?”</p>

<p>“Aye, for Woosonametipom goes to join
Philip and in the morning the village will be
vanished.”</p>

<p>“And I? Think you—”</p>

<p>“The sachem will take you with him,
since he may not leave you behind. Be cautious,
my brother, and guard your tongue,
for now all are hot with the lust for battle
and their hands are near their knives.”</p>

<p>“I thought of seeking escape over the wall,
Pikot. Once in the forest—”</p>

<p>“Nay, for the village is well guarded and
the trail southward swarms with enemies.
Try it not. Do the sachem’s bidding and
leave the matter of your escape to your
friends. We will not fail you. Farewell,
Noawama.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, Monapikot. I pray you give
my love to my father if you meet him and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
tell him that all is well with me. Bid him
not to trouble for me. And so to Obid. Farewell!”</p>

<p>When the Pegan went, David could not
tell, for no sound came to him, but when,
after a moment, David called softly again,
there was no answer.</p>

<p>Comforted, and with much to think on,
David stretched himself on his bed. The revelry
was dying out, and so the fire, and although
the village did not gain its usual quiet
that night, but was ever filled with murmurings
and movements, the drums ceased before
long and the war-chants ended. And
David, lighter of heart than in many a day,
soon dropped to sleep again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<small>METIPOM TAKES THE WAR-PATH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>He awoke to find John tugging at him. The
wigwam was barely alight, but sounds told
him that the village was well astir. The Indian
had brought instructions from the sachem
and the wherewithal to carry them out.
David was to take the trail with them and to
that end must look to be one of the tribe.
First his body must be stained, and then he
must put on the scanty garments that lay
in a small heap beside the couch. With small
enthusiasm David yielded to John’s ministrations.
A brown liquid from a small kettle,
still warm, was rubbed over him from head
to feet, and where it touched him the whiteness
of his skin disappeared and a coppery-red
took its place. David viewed the result
with misgivings.</p>

<p>“Shall I ever come clean again?” he
asked. “Will water remove it, John?”</p>

<p>“Nay, it will not wash off, brother, but in
time it will go.” John stood back and viewed
his work proudly. “None would know that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
you were not of our people, David. Very
brave and beautiful you look.”</p>

<p>“Do I so?” asked the boy dryly. “Yet
methinks I prefer my own skin better. However,
an it pleases you and will some day
disappear, I mind not. What now?”</p>

<p>“The sachem sends you these.”</p>

<p>“What! That thing? Nay, I will not go
about the world naked for Metipom or any
one! And so you may say to him!”</p>

<p>But in the end, mindful of Monapikot’s
advice, he donned the costume provided;
loin-cloth, belt, moccasins, and necklet. All
were of the best and much ornamented with
quills and wampum. As for the moccasins,
he was glad enough to have them, for his
shoes had long since worn through at sides
and bottoms and provided scant protection
for his feet. John grew every minute more
proud of the miracle he was working and
must momentarily pause to admire and
praise. And when David thought all complete,
and viewed his brown nakedness with
a mixture of shame and interest, John produced
white and blue pigments and, with the
absorption of an artist before his canvas,
traced meaningless lines and figures on the
boy’s chest and face. Then, with David<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
grumbling wrathfully, the Indian wove three
red feathers into his hair, and, picking up the
bow that Sequanawah had fashioned, put it
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Now!” he announced. “Go and see
yourself in the water of the spring, my brother,
and be vain.”</p>

<p>“More like ashamed,” David grumbled.
“Whither do we go, and when?”</p>

<p>“I know not whither, but when the women
are ready for the journey we start.”</p>

<p>David pushed aside the skin that hid the
entrance and gazed forth in astonishment.
The Indian village was gone save for the
palisade and, here and there, a bark wigwam.
Otherwise the lodges were down and
the skins and mats that had formed them
were rolled and tied with thongs and lay
ready for transportation on the backs of the
squaws. Fires still smouldered and a few
families were yet partaking of food. Dogs
barked excitedly and the younger children
called shrilly. Everywhere was confusion and
bustle.</p>

<p>As David watched the unusual scene, the
sun, hotly red, crept over the rim of the
world and in the valley eastward the blue-gray
mist wavered above the parched earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
The old squaw came with food ready cooked,
and brought, too, a sack of parched corn for
David’s pouch. The food he devoured as he
stood, and then, John having returned to his
own family, he made his way to the spring,
somewhat shamefacedly, and, as he scooped
the water from it, saw himself reflected
vaguely in the surface. The first glimpse was
startling, for he who looked back from the
rippled mirror might well have been a young
Indian. Even the boy’s features seemed to
have changed; as, indeed, they had since his
coming to the village, for lean living had
sharpened the cheek-bones and made thinner
the nose; and now it was a Wachoosett
brave, painted and feathered, who was reflected
back from the spring. The vision
brought a little thrill to David, for there was
something almost uncanny in the marvels
wrought by the stain and the pigment and
the few gay feathers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An hour later the exodus had begun. A
handful of braves had left the village long
before, and at intervals others had followed,
but the main body of the tribe began to
straggle through the gate an hour after
sun-up. Ahead, pretending no military order,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
but armed and watchful, went the warriors,
all painted and panoplied with bows
and spears. Well in the van stalked Woosonametipom,
a striking figure in a cloak of
green cloth edged with soft yellow feathers
below which his unclad legs emerged startlingly.
Much wampum he wore, and his face
was disfigured with a blue disk on each
cheek and a figure not unlike a Maltese cross
done in yellow on his forehead. Metipom
carried a musket, as did several others. Next
to the warriors went the older boys, armed
with bows, and behind them were the men
past the fighting age and the squaws, maidens
and children. Only occasionally did one of
the men or boys carry any burden, and then
it was like to be some treasured object like
an iron kettle or a bundle of pelts. It was
the women and maidens, and even the children,
who bore the household things: skins
and mats for wigwams, cooking-utensils,
food supplies, babies, and a general miscellany
of belongings too precious to leave behind.
Used to such form of drudgery, however,
the squaws kept pace with the men and
asked no favor.</p>

<p>David found that he was to be allowed no
chance of escape, for two painted and oil-smeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
braves guarded him closely. He was
permitted to retain his bow and arrows, but
he had neither knife, spear, nor tomahawk.
The pace set by the leaders was brisk and by
mid-morning they had crossed two small
streams and left some ten or a dozen miles
behind them. Straight into the west they
had gone, for the most part through park-like
forest from which the underbrush had
been fired the autumn before, following well-defined
trails. Camp was made on the slope
of a hill and there they rested until afternoon.
Some of the scouts joined them here
and made reports to the sachem. John
brought food to David and afterwards fetched
him water from a brook that ran at the
foot of the slope.</p>

<p>David’s skin, unaccustomed as it was to
exposure, had suffered from the heat of the
sun, and he was glad to seek the shade and
burrow into the cool fronds of a patch of
ferns. The shadows were lengthening when
the journey began again. Now the way led
more to the south, and close to sunset a
broad valley lay before them through which
a shallow river flowed. Keeping to the hills,
Metipom led his warriors southward until
dusk, by which time they had reached a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
grassy swale between two wooded heights.
Here there was a fine spring of water as well
as plenty of young, straight growth suitable
for lodge-poles, and here permanent camp
was made. That night David slept, though
not very soundly, under the stars, with his
two guards close beside him.</p>

<p>In the morning the women began the construction
of the lodges while the men prepared
for their business of war. Some few
of the older men and boys went in search of
game and the maidens to seek berries, but
for the most part the Indians toiled at
erecting wigwams or adding to their store of
arrows and spears. Sequanawah and another
came to the new village during the morning
and there followed a conclave of the sachem
and his counselors. David was put to work
with some of the youths at raising lodge-poles,
and, since in that treeless place the sun
had full way with his tender skin, he was
soon in agony. At last he could stand it no
longer and, amid the shrill gibes of his companions,
took his suffering body to the lee of
a wigwam and found some comfort in the
shade. There Sequanawah later found him
and, seeing the puffed condition of his back
and shoulders, brought a fat and pitying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
squaw who anointed his burns with a cooling
salve that brought instant relief.</p>

<p>“I am weary,” said the Indian when the
squaw had gone again. “I have traveled
many leagues since we parted, David, and
the heat has baked my vitals. I had not
thought to see my brother so soon, for it was
not so said. The Great Sachem lays his plans
to-day and to-morrow rubs them out with
his foot.”</p>

<p>Sequanawah drew a moccasin over the
grass and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Sequanawah?”
asked David.</p>

<p>The Indian waved a lean hand vaguely.
“Into the sunset and back,” he answered.</p>

<p>David smiled faintly. “Aye? And what
saw you, brother?”</p>

<p>A reflection of the boy’s smile flickered in
the black eyes of the Indian, though he replied
gravely enough. “Deer in the forest
and fish in the streams.”</p>

<p>“Were any white, my brother?”</p>

<p>“Nay.” Sequanawah shook his head. “I
sought not your people, David.”</p>

<p>“Is Philip near by, then?”</p>

<p>“He comes.”</p>

<p>“Hither?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“I know not. Stay you close to the wigwams,
David, and ask no questions.”</p>

<p>“That is no easy task, Sequanawah, when
my people perish.”</p>

<p>“Many will be left, brother. Philip cannot
win this war, for the White-Faces are
too many against him. In the end he must
hide or yield. Yet ere that comes about the
forest leaves will be red with blood and many
of your people and mine will seek the Great
Spirit. I go now to have sleep, my brother.”</p>

<p>In spite of Monapikot’s advice, David
was resolved to let no opportunity to escape
his captors be wasted, for by keeping his ears
open he had learned that English settlements
lay near by, notably that of Brookfield,
which, he believed, was little more than
twelve miles south of the present encampment.
Yet, although his guards that night
relaxed their vigilance, so well was the village
picketed that any attempt at escape
would have been futile. The next morning
strange Indians came, mean and povern-seeming
savages to the number of eight.
These, he learned, were from the small tribe
of Quaboags, dwelling beyond Brookfield.
They spent more than an hour in Metipom’s
wigwam and then departed southward. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the number more than half bore muskets of
ancient pattern. With them went Sequanawah
and two other captains.</p>

<p>During the day several parties of from six
to a dozen or more warriors left the village
in different directions, and at intervals
scouts returned and made report to the sachem.</p>

<p>Woosonametipom was now living in less
state, his lodge being small and unadorned.
Most of the time he sat in front of it, smoking
or dozing when no affairs demanded attention.
It was evident to David that the
present village, while designed to be occupied
for some time, was not intended to be permanent.
This was shown by the makeshift
manner of erecting the lodges and by the fact
that the squaws had not unpacked certain
of their bundles brought from the Wachoosett
country. Probably, he thought, it was
Metipom’s intention to join Philip and follow
that sagamore’s wanderings. The site
had doubtless been chosen with a view to
secretness and safety from sudden surprise.
The place was like a pocket, with the opening
toward the wooded valley that ran north
and south. On three sides of the pocket the
hills arose sufficiently to hide it, and, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
but sparsely timbered, afforded a far view of
the country about. By day and night
watchers, stationed on the heights and at the
entrance of the grassy pocket, formed a complete
cordon about the encampment. Attack,
should it come, would naturally come from
the valley, and in that case it would be simple
enough for the Wachoosetts, should they
choose flight rather than battle, to slip back
across the hill toward the east.</p>

<p>Toward sunset of the second day in the
new village, David went down the slope
toward where the spring burbled from beneath
the twisted roots of a great ash tree.
His sunburn still pained him and many
small blisters had come on his shoulders.
Three squaws were filling kettles at the
spring, and to one of them he made known
his desire for laving his body. When she at
last understood what it was he wished, the
woman took much delight in filling her kettle
and emptying it over his shoulders, a service
soon entered into by the other squaws, who,
whatever their opinion of such procedure
might have been, gained much amusement
thereby and plied their kettles so diligently
that the boy was soon choking and sputtering,
to the entertainment of a near-by picket.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
David at length had to flee or be drowned,
and so he fled, laughing, around the tree and
into the thicket that lay beyond, pursued by
the youngest of the three women who, finding
her quarry escaping, sent the contents of her
kettle after him and gave up the chase. Shivering
a little, for the evening was cooling with
the descent of the sun, David paused to make
certain that the squaws had withdrawn. Although
he could not see them through the
leaves, he heard their guttural laughter
diminish as they plodded off up the gentle
slope toward the lodges, and was on the point
of emerging from his sanctuary and following
when a sudden thought bade him pause.</p>

<p>Unintentionally he had passed between the
watchers and so far none had challenged. It
might be that by remaining where he was
until darkness he could get away unseen. In
the meanwhile if any sought him he could
pretend slumber or illness as his reason for
not returning. Crouching, he peered between
the lower branches of the bushes. At one side,
some twenty yards away, the picket who had
watched the proceedings at the spring had
turned and was again squatting motionless
and staring into the forest. On the other side
the next picket was not visible, but David<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
knew that he was stationed on the first rise
of the little hill that began at the thicket’s
edge. It seemed that the first of the two had
already forgotten David’s existence. Perhaps
he was under the belief that the captive
had returned with the squaws. In any case,
it appeared to David that the Indian was no
more concerned with him and that he did
not suspect his presence in the thicket.</p>

<p>With a little thrill of excitement the boy
lowered himself quietly to the ground, brushing
aside all twigs that might break and give
alarm. He forgot to be chilly, forgot even
the smarting and burning and itching of his
back and shoulders, for the prospect of making
his escape filled him with an exultation
that warmed his heart and filled his thoughts.</p>

<p>Quickly the twilight came, for the forest
soon shut off the last rays of the sinking sun.
From the wigwams came the murmur of
voices, the snarling of dogs, the crackling of
evening fires. A breath of wind crept down
the hillside and rustled the leaves about him.
It brought the fragrance of burning wood and
of cooking food and reminded him that he
was hungry. But hunger was such a small
matter now that he only smiled grimly and
strove to be patient while the dusk changed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
lingeringly to darkness. At last his hand held
before his nose was but a faint gray oblong
and, fearing that if he tarried longer those
whose duty it was to guard him would discover
his absence and give the alarm, he decided
to begin his attempt.</p>

<p>Before darkness had fallen, he had studied
the ground about him and chosen a path.
Now he set out to follow it. Prone on the
ground, he squirmed forward, thrusting
aside the slender trunks of the bushes with
cautious hands and freeing his path of twigs
and fallen branches. In spite of his efforts,
absolute silence was impossible, and more
than once his heart leaped into his mouth as
a tiny <em>snap</em> was heard or a bush, released too
quickly, rustled back into place. But though
the sounds seemed alarmingly loud to him,
they were doubtless no more than the natural
noises of the night to the picket. Inch by
inch and foot by foot David made his way
through the thicket, leaving the village each
moment farther behind. At last the bushes
ended, or rather thinned, and the trunks of
trees were about him. With a breath of relief
he carefully got to his feet and, still testing
every step, made his way noiselessly
toward the south, guiding himself by frequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
glimpses of a great white star that
hung in the sky above the tree-tops. When a
quarter of an hour had passed in cautious
progress, he told himself that at last he had
succeeded in making his escape, and that, unless
he was so unfortunate as to fall into the
hands of a scouting party by daylight, he
should be within sight of an English settlement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<small>IN KING PHILIP’S POWER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The eastern sky paled beyond the green-clad
hills. A bird high on the topmost branch
of a great oak tree chirped experimentally
and then burst into a trilling welcome to the
new day. A flush of rose crept above the
horizon and cast its fairy radiance through
the cloistered forest. To the weary boy who
leaned against the smooth, cool bole of a
beech tree the coming of dawn was grateful,
indeed. All through the night he had traversed
the woods, resting at times for short
periods, silently, cautiously, guiding his steps
by the stars. Progress had been woefully
slow, and now that day was approaching he
had scant knowledge of the distance he had
traveled. He had heard an Indian say that
the English town of Brookfield was a “little
journey” to the south of the Wachoosett encampment.
A “little journey” meant usually
from ten to a dozen English miles,
although the Indians were grandly vague in
such matters. It seemed to David as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
paused to rest that he must surely have traveled
that distance, and now he searched the
forest for indications of cleared country.
Near at hand a half-dry little stream wandered
between ledges and fern banks, and
David sought it and drank deeply and laved
face and hands in the cool water. Then, refreshed,
he turned his steps away from the
dawn and set out to find the settlement.</p>

<p>Presently a well-defined path lay before
him, proceeding in the general direction of
the course he had chosen. The path was wide
and hard-trodden and tempted him sorely.
By taking it he could make much better
progress, but there was always the possibility
of an unwelcome meeting on the trail. Still,
not once since he had slipped away from the
Wachoosett village had he so much as heard
a footstep, and it seemed quite probable to
him that he was now close to Brookfield and
that enemy savages would not be found so
near to the settlement. So, after a moment’s
deliberation, he stepped forth into the path
and went on quickly, though keeping a sharp
watch the while. The trail turned and wound
frequently and he kept close at one side or
the other that he might step back from sight
if needs be. A dog barked afar off and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
answered. The light increased steadily, and
suddenly and like a miracle the forest became
filled with the golden radiance of the
sun. Only the upper reaches of the trees were
illumined as yet and down below the blue
shadows still lingered, but the sight brought
joy and new courage to the traveler. And
then, silently skirting a bend in the path, his
heart stood still for an instant ere it began
a wild tattoo against his ribs. Not ten paces
before him stood two savages, short, stocky
men in full war paraphernalia, painted and
feathered. Retreat would have been futile,
for they had seen him as soon as he had
seen them. Remained only to put a good face
on the encounter and win by. A second look
showed David that, whatever the Indians
were, they were not Wachoosetts. Nor did it
seem that they were natives of the country
thereabouts. Their tomahawks were long-hilted
and heavy of head and their girdles
hung lower in front. And yet they might be
Quaboags, in which case he had nothing to
fear, since so far the Quaboags still professed
friendship for the English.</p>

<p>His pause had been but momentary, and
now he went forward, one hand outspread
in the Nipmuck salutation. “Netop!” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
called. The strangers made no answer for
a moment, but looked him up and down with
sidelong glances. Then one replied in a language
the boy did not know. But the words
were plainly a question, and David, resolving
to pass himself off for what he seemed, a
Wachoosett, answered in the Nipmuck
tongue.</p>

<p>“I am a Wachoosett,” he said. “Woosonametipom
is my sachem. We lodge three
leagues northward. We come on a friendly
visit to this country. Who are you, brothers?”</p>

<p>The Indians seemed to understand something
of what he said. Doubtless the words
Wachoosett and Woosonametipom were familiar:
perhaps others, since many words
were similar in the different tongues. One
of the two, a cruel-visaged savage with much
tattooing on his body, grunted doubtfully,
but the other embarked on a long speech,
none of which David could fathom. But he
listened gravely and respectfully, paused at
one side of the path, until the man had ended.
Then he replied with all the compliments
and friendly phrases he could muster in Nipmuck;
and wished all the time that he had
at least a knife or spear. It was the cruel-faced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
one who solved the difficulty of intercourse
by lapsing into what passed for English
with him.</p>

<p>“No talk um talk. Where um go?”</p>

<p>“I go Brookfield. Which way um, brother?”</p>

<p>“What for um go Brookfield?”</p>

<p>“I take message to English from my sachem.”</p>

<p>“Where um message?” The savage held
out a hand imperiously.</p>

<p>David shook his head and pointed to his
forehead. “In here,” he replied. Then he
pointed down the path. “Brookfield this
way?” he asked.</p>

<p>The other bowed, but shot a suspicious
and scowling look from under his brows.
David took a long breath and stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Farewell, brothers.”</p>

<p>Mutters were their only response. David
swung on, a prickly sensation along his spine.
That he had fooled them into thinking him
a Wachoosett Indian scarcely seemed possible.
Indeed, the uglier of the two had plainly
been incredulous from the first. But, after a
dozen paces, he began to hope, and he was
congratulating himself when <a href="#i_fp224">there was a </a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
<a href="#i_fp224">swift <em>whiz-zt</em> beside him and an arrow embedded
itself in a sapling</a> a few yards ahead
of him. He turned swiftly and plunged into
the wood. As he dropped to cover, he was
conscious of a stinging pain in his left shoulder,
and looking he beheld an arrow thrust
into the soft part of his upper arm. Fortunately,
it had no more than buried its head,
and he wrenched it loose and, sinking behind
a tree, held it clutched in his right hand as
he peered cautiously forth. It was not much
of a weapon, to be sure, but it gave him
some comfort to feel even so poor a defense
in his grasp. The Indians were coming
toward his hiding-place at a slow trot, with
many pauses. One had fitted another arrow
to his bow, but the second held only his
tomahawk as he advanced. Flight, as hopeless
as it seemed, was David’s only course,
and in an instant he was up and away, dashing
from tree to tree. An arrow flew past
him; footsteps sounded above the thumping
of his heart. A good runner, David’s night-long
journey had left him with little strength
for the present task, and after a minute he
saw that capture was certain, for already the
swifter of the two pursuers was close behind
him and he knew without looking that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
stone tomahawk was raised in air. With his
back to a big tree he stopped and faced them
and gestured surrender.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp224">
  <img src="images/i_fp224.jpg" alt="" title="">
  <figcaption class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_224">THERE WAS A SWIFT <em>whiz-zt</em> BESIDE HIM AND AN ARROW EMBEDDED ITSELF IN A SAPLING</a></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They, too, stopped while still a few paces
away, drawing apart that he might not slip
past. The ugly one grinned wickedly and
swung his tomahawk with ferocious menace.</p>

<p>“Why um Englishman run?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why did you shoot at me?” demanded
David sternly.</p>

<p>The other savage replied. “Um say um
Wachoosett. What for tell um lie, brother?”</p>

<p>“I am Englishman, aye, but I come from
Woosonametipom’s lodge. I am friend of
Wachoosett, friend of Indians. I not know
if you be my friend. So I say I’m Wachoosett.
You see I no have weapon.”</p>

<p>“You come along me,” growled the cruel-faced
Indian. “No run away. Me kill.”</p>

<p>“Where I go?” asked David.</p>

<p>“You no ask um question. You come
along grand.”</p>

<p>The savage pointed back along the trail
with his big tomahawk. After an instant’s
indecision, David went. They put him ahead
and followed close behind him. In such manner
the three traversed a hundred rods of
the trail. Then a hand on the boy’s arm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
swung him to the right and he discerned a
faintly visible path, scarcely more than a
deer runway, that led toward the east. For
a good half-hour he traveled, now turning
right and now left, and at last the woods
thinned and a rocky hillside meadow came
into sight. Along the border of this they
passed and crossed a muddy stream, and,
with the morning sunlight full in their faces,
mounted a bushy ridge and went down the
other side of it and into a tract of marshy
ground grown head-high with yellowing
rushes and interspersed with alder and white
birch. A dog barked suddenly from close at
hand, so unexpectedly that David, picking
his steps across the swamp, started and went
floundering to his knees in the slimy water.
In another instant the rushes were gone,
trampled flat by many feet, and a little island
sprang from the marsh, and David saw many
Indians and some rude huts of branches and
bark before him. A mangy dog rushed at his
legs and ran off howling as one of the boy’s
captors struck him with his bow. The sunlit
air was filled with the smoke of fires, voices
growled, and David was thrust into the midst
of a group of painted savages.</p>

<p>More curious than unfriendly they seemed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
but that was due to the fact that for a moment
they failed to penetrate his disguise.
It was not until his captors spoke, explaining
and pointing, that the Indians began to murmur
and growl and even laugh derisively.
One seized David’s scalp-lock and gave it a
mighty tug as if expecting it to come off like
a wig, and David, resenting the pain,
thoughtlessly struck his arm away. The Indian,
a tall, bone-faced brave, uttered a cry
and thrust forward with the spear held in his
other hand. But David saw in time and
leaped back, crowding against the throng behind
him, and one of his captors interposed
and the crowd laughed a little. At this moment
David was aware of one who was pushing
his way toward him with no gentle use of
his elbows, a large and heavily built Indian
who wore a coat that was covered entirely
with wampum of many hues arranged not
unpleasingly in strange designs. Authority
became him well, for, although there was
something sinister in the cold glitter of his
eyes, his features were not unpleasing and
held a certain nobility, and David, observing
all fell back in deference, and seeing that
wampum coat whose fame was widespread,
knew that he was face to face with the arch-enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
King Philip, sachem of the Wampanoags.</p>

<p>Pushing aside one of David’s captors, who
had interposed between the boy and the Indian
with the spear, King Philip looked for
a moment at the prisoner with straight and
piercing gaze. Then, in a pleasant voice and
with friendly mien, he asked: “You English?”</p>

<p>“Aye.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“David Lindall.”</p>

<p>“Where you dwell, David?”</p>

<p>“Near the long rapids of the Charles
River, westward of Nonantum.”</p>

<p>“You know Great Teacher Eliot, maybe,
by place called Natick?”</p>

<p>“Aye, his village of the Praying Indians
is but two leagues from my father’s house.”</p>

<p>“He is fine man,” said Pometacom gravely.
“Come to my lodge, David, and make
talk.”</p>

<p>The wigwam of the sachem was a small
and poorly built affair of bark over poles.
There were a few pieces of rush matting on
the floor and a few cooking-utensils beside
the still warm ashes of the fire. David saw
that there were neither women nor children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
about, while he estimated the number of
Pometacom’s warriors at near sixty, a number
much smaller than he would have surmised.
With the chief went a young and
strikingly intelligent appearing Indian,
named Caleb, who was even more gaudily
bedecked than the sachem himself, save for
the latter’s famous wampum coat. All seated
themselves, and then, having lighted his pipe
with much care and deliberation, King
Philip, still speaking in a gentle fashion,
questioned David closely. The latter, determining
to tell a truthful story, told of his
adventures from the time of his capture by
Sequanawah, and the sachem heard him
silently, nodding now and then, puffing occasional
volumes of choking smoke from his
stone pipe. The second Indian listened as
closely, but there was an expression on his
face that David did not like. When he had
ended his narrative, the sachem, to David’s
intense surprise, asked abruptly:</p>

<p>“You know Captain Hutchinson?”</p>

<p>“Hutchinson? Nay, I know him not, King
Philip.”</p>

<p>“You come from Brookfield?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I was seeking Brookfield when
your warriors fell upon me, as I have told.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“You tell lies!” The sachem’s voice
deepened to an angry growl. “You English
spy. You make show you Wachoosett. You
put red juice on your body and feather in
your hair. You say you go with message
from Woosonametipom Sachem to English
at Brookfield village. You tell so to my warriors
when they find you in forest. You not
make fool of Philip! You tell me truth, David!”</p>

<p>“I have told you the truth, King Philip.
If you doubt me, you need but send a messenger
to Woosonametipom. He will tell you
that I speak truth.”</p>

<p>The sachem wagged his head from side to
side and motioned fretfully with the hand
that held his pipe. “I not believe. You spy.
Maybe I kill you, maybe I not. You answer
me truth what I ask; we see. How many
fighting men this Captain Hutchinson
have?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>The sachem rewarded him with a sidelong,
drooping glance that sent a chill down the
boy’s spine and spoke with the younger Indian
in native language. Then for several
minutes King Philip spat questions at David,
seeking, it appeared, to learn what forces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
of the English were in that vicinity, and
likewise the identity of certain Indians who,
it seemed, were serving with the English as
guides. But to not one question could David
make intelligent answer, and the sachem
grew each moment more incensed, until, in
the end, he tossed his pipe on the ground
and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“You not talk now, you English dog, but
soon you talk grand! Much heat make
tongue wag! Plenty fire you get, plenty talk
you make! You see!”</p>

<p>The younger Indian pulled David to his
feet and thrust him before him through the
doorway. Outside he called others and they
came gathering about with cruel, snarling
grins. He who had haled him forth spoke
for a minute, evidently directing, and then
hands were again laid on the boy and he was
pushed and dragged over the ground toward
where, at an edge of the swamp island, a lone
cedar tree stood. Until they approached it,
David believed the sachem’s threat to be but
idle, born of exasperation and anger, but now
he knew that it was to be carried out. Fear
and desperation lent him strength. Wrenching
himself free from the grasps of those who
held him, he shot a clenched fist into the face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
of one before him, eluded a second, and
dashed for freedom. But the attempt was
hopeless from the first. Before him lay
morass and stagnant pools, and even had he
reached the swamp, he would have been soon
recaptured. As it was, he was overtaken before
he had gained it and found himself
writhing, striking, even kicking with moccasined
feet, in the grasp of many angry foes.
And so, although he struck some lusty blows,
he was speedily subdued, and lay, panting
and glaring, on the ground while thongs were
passed about his wrists and ankles and drawn
cruelly tight. Then he was borne to the tree
and held on his feet while, with his back
against the twisted trunk, other ropes and
thongs made him fast to it. His wrists were
unbound and his arms drawn back around
the tree and then secured again, which
brought him into an attitude of much pain.
When the last knot was tied, the Indians
drew back and inspected him with grunts of
satisfaction and smiles of cruel pleasure, and
one whose bleeding lips proclaimed him as
the recipient of David’s blow stepped forward
and struck him brutally in the face.
The boy, seeing the savage’s intention, jerked
his head aside and the blow landed on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
side of his chin. But even so, it dazed him for
a moment, and in that moment another delivered
a resounding slap with open palm
against David’s face. The boy’s head dropped
to his shoulder and his eyes closed, and, seeing
him so, the Indians, muttering and spitting
upon him, went their ways.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<small>THE ISLAND IN THE SWAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>David’s coma lasted but a few moments, and
when he raised his head again, save that the
persecutors had left him, everything was as
before. The Indians had returned to their
former occupations about the camp; a few
taking food, others playing at their gambling
games, still more lolling with pipes beside
the rude wigwams. David, in spite of the
dizzy, ringing feeling of his head and the
weakness of his body, took heart. That they
did not mean to torture him at once was evident,
and while there was life there was hope.
He found that by straightening his body he
could secure relief from the painful straining
of his arms, although he well knew that ere
long that relief would fail him. The sun was
climbing above the tops of the few trees that
thrust their straggling branches from the
swamp and the day promised to be close and
hot. Already thirst was parching his throat.
Food he had no wish for now. As the sunlight
warmed the stagnant water of the
partly dried morass around the island, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
fetid odor filled the air, and flies and mosquitoes
began to increase the captive’s sufferings.
The English held that mosquitoes
did not bite the Indians, and while this was
not literally true, yet it was a fact, as David
had observed, that the troublesome insects
had less liking for the savages than for those
of white blood. Perchance the boy’s stained
skin deceived the pests into mistaking him
for a savage, since, while they bothered him
greatly by alighting upon him, they seemed
not to sting save infrequently. But the flies,
a particularly bloodthirsty sort whose bodies
gleamed in the sunlight like green jewels,
cared not what color the skins of their victims
might be and so proved of more painful
annoyance than the mosquitoes. Fortunately,
the cedar despite its twisted, misshapen
body, provided fair shade from the sun’s hot
rays as the morning progressed and David
was spared one form of torture.</p>

<p>None heeded him. The hours passed and
the heat of the August day increased, and David’s
thirst became well-nigh intolerable.
Altering the position of his body within the
scant allowance of the thongs that held him
no longer brought surcease from pain. His
arms ached in every muscle and nerve, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the cord about his wrists cut into the flesh.
Despondency grew, and by the time the sun
was at the zenith he longed desperately for
the merciful release of a bullet. At last, unable
to bear the anguish of thirst longer, he
cried with dry tongue for water. An Indian
preparing food above a tiny fire of twigs near
by looked stolidly across at him, hunched his
glistening shoulders, and gave his attention
again to the earthen dish before him. David
raised his voice in a cracked cry and repeated
his plea many times, but none more than
stared at him. With a sob of self-pity the boy
closed his eyes and let his head fall on his
breast, and a sort of semi-consciousness enveloped
him. From it he was presently
aroused by the speaking of his name. Before
him stood King Philip, Caleb, and several
others of his company. He viewed them
dully, his mind but half awake.</p>

<p>“You maybe talk some now,” said the
sachem, smiling evilly. “You maybe tell me
things and speak truth, David. What say?”</p>

<p>David sought to moisten his parched lips.
“Water!” he muttered.</p>

<p>The sachem spoke to one of his attendants
and presently a cup was held to the boy’s
lips. But no more than a few swallows was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
allowed him and the precious fluid was withdrawn
in spite of his groans and panting
pleas.</p>

<p>“You talk first,” said the sachem. “Then
you have much water. Where this man Captain
Willard lodge now?”</p>

<p>David shook his head weakly. What the
sachem said was but a meaningless jumble
of words to him. King Philip’s brow darkened.</p>

<p>“No talk yet? We see! Maybe you cold,
David. Maybe you want fire.”</p>

<p>Again he spoke in his own tongue and two
Indians left the group. David had a premonition
of danger, but his mind, drugged by
suffering, sensed but vaguely what the sachem
intended. He closed his eyes wearily
and only opened them when the Indians
threw armfuls of dried twigs and branches at
his feet. Even then he but glanced down for
an instant with indifferent eyes. The sachem
spoke again to him, but David heard as
though from a distance and made no answer.
Then a stab of pain dispelled his languor and
his eyes opened protestingly. The young Indian
Caleb, grinning fiendishly, was pressing
the point of his knife into the boy’s shoulder.
David flinched and moaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe you talk?” demanded the sachem,
his face thrust close to David’s, his eyes hard
with wrath and cruelty. “Philip not burn
you all up quick, David. Philip make you
roast little, then you cool off. Maybe you
talk plenty. Speak, you English dog-pup!”</p>

<p>“I know—nothing,” mumbled David.
“Give me—water!”</p>

<p>“Water? I give you fire! I make your
tongue hang from your mouth! I make you
suffer grand like your people make my children
and my squaws suffer. You see!”</p>

<p>From the swamp to the west came the
shrill call of a jay, twice repeated. At the
first sound King Philip and those beside him
stiffened to attention. At the third they
turned and strode toward the center of the
camp. David closed his eyes again and his
head fell forward and merciful unconsciousness
came over him.</p>

<p>From the swamp a straggling line of savages
emerged and, signing greetings, approached
the sachem. A scant dozen in all,
most bore muskets and a number showed
wounds that still dripped blood. They were
not of Philip’s company, but were Quaboags,
and with them were three sagamores, Quanansit,
Apequinash, and Mawtamps. One,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
with bound hands, was plainly a prisoner.
With few words the visitors seated themselves,
following the example of Philip and
his captains, and pipes were lighted. Then
Quanansit spoke.</p>

<p>They had fought with the English and had
killed many. The English were retreating
to the garrison at Brookfield, pursued by
nearly two hundred Quaboags. This man,
Memecho, they had taken prisoner. He had
guided the enemy and fought on his side.
They made a present of him to the Great
Sachem of the Wampanoags. It had happened
thus. The English at Brookfield had
sought a parley with the Quaboags, wishful
of exacting a promise from them of friendship.
The Indians had thereupon agreed to
meet a company of the English, headed by
Captain Wheeler and Captain Hutchinson,
at a certain place three miles from the village
that morning. The English had sought
the locality, and not finding the Quaboags,
who knew better than to expose themselves
on the plain, had set forth toward Wickabaug
Pond, guided by three Christian Indians,
amongst them this Memecho. When
their way had led them between a swamp on
one side and a high bluff on the other, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
Quaboags, lying in wait, had attacked. Eight
of the English had fallen at the first fire, and
three more had been wounded so that they
must die. Of these was Captain Hutchinson.
The English had fought back for a time, and
then, finding themselves like to be exterminated
by a foe they could scarce see, had retreated
toward the garrison, pursued by the
Quaboags. Of the latter none had been killed
and but few wounded.</p>

<p>“How many were in their company?”
asked King Philip.</p>

<p>“Twenty, all mounted on horses, and the
three Indians,” answered Quanansit.</p>

<p>“How many are in the village?”</p>

<p>“We do not know, for some have come of
late to aid them. Yet no more than eighty
in all, we think.”</p>

<p>“Good, Quanansit! Let none escape.
Send a messenger to the Wachoosett sagamore,
Woosonametipom, and bid him bring
forward all his warriors. Encompass the village
that none may leave or enter. At nightfall
I will come also and when darkness hides
us we will attack. Leave one here to serve as
guide to me, Quanansit.”</p>

<p>“This man will I leave, Philip. His name
is Wompatannawa, a captain of the Niantics,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
and he knows all paths and will guide you
straightly.”</p>

<p>“Good. And now, that you have done
wisely and bravely, to you and to Apequinash
and to Mawtamps I will make presents. I am
poor, for the enemy has burned my village
and sacked my lodges, but one treasure I
still have. Give me a knife, Caleb.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, removing his wampum coat,
Philip cut three pieces from it, each containing
near a peck of wampum, and gave the
pieces to the three sagamores. The Indian
Caleb observed the act frowningly and when
Philip would have returned his knife he said:
“I, too, have served, O Philip. Is there no
reward for me?”</p>

<p>The sachem gravely picked a single wampum
bead from the garment and handed it
to him. “I reward according to your desert,
O Caleb. This for your bravery in battle. It
was but a few smokes since that I saw you
kill a fly.”</p>

<p>In the laugh that followed, Caleb angrily
ground the wampum bead into the earth
with his heel.</p>

<p>Food was brought to the Quaboags and
afterwards they smoked, but before that one
of their number, disencumbering himself of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
his musket, had set forth through the forest
to bear King Philip’s command to Woosonametipom.
When the afternoon was half
spent, the visitors, all save him they called
Wompatannawa, took their departure, and
Philip’s company began their preparations
for the attack on the garrison at Brookfield,
some six miles distant, looking to their weapons
and ammunition, painting their bodies
afresh and filling their pouches with
rations of parched corn or dried fish. Two
medicine men gravely made incantations
about a circle drawn in the earth wherein
lay strange objects; a human hand, dried
and colored like the root of a tree, some colored
pebbles, a string of wampum twisted
about an arrow, the feet of a crow tied together
with a red yarn, and other things.
They chanted monotonously in low voices
and stamped the earth, and sometimes turned
their bodies about slowly with their arms upstretched
to the brazen sky. Philip had returned
to his wigwam for slumber, but Caleb
sat disconsolately and moodily outside and
with his knife whittled at a bit of wood. To
him presently came the Nipmuck, Wompatannawa,
and sat beside him and talked.
Later the stranger arose and idly wandered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
about the village, strictly observing the etiquette
which forbade any semblance of
curiosity. Presently in his wanderings he
drew near to the cedar tree against which a
brown body was held with thongs of deer-hide
and rope. Idly the stranger looked,
and then, spitting toward the captive, turned
his back and went on. This, since his eyes
were closed, the bound youth did not see.</p>

<p>The sun hung for a while above the forest
trees in the west and then sank from sight.
A few fires sent pencils of blue smoke straight
aloft into the purpling twilight. The dogs,
arousing from their somnolence, began their
prowling and snarling. Food was eaten and
water drank. King Philip, no longer bedecked
with his wampum coat, emerged from
his lodge and drew his counselors about him.
A cool air came out of the southwest and the
hovering hordes of insects disappeared. That
refreshing breath caused David’s eyelids to
flutter, and presently a long sigh passed his
lips and a tremor passed through his body.
His eyes opened slowly and reason, restored
by the long period of unconsciousness, dwelt
again in his aching brain. Before him the
encampment showed unaccustomed activity
in the deepening twilight. Lodges were deserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
and all the warriors were gathered near
the center of the island, armed and freshly
painted. Of the number no more than thirty
bore guns, the boy observed. Even as he began
to sense what such activity indicated,
the Indians moved away toward the swamp,
led by one whose slim height and grace
aroused the ghost of memory in his tired
mind. Silently the warriors passed into the
twilight of the swamp, a sinister train of dark
bodies merging with the shadows of the reeds
and bushes. The last faint pat of footsteps
died away and an eerie stillness descended
on the island. Occasionally a rustling
sounded from the thicket beyond as a bird
stirred or a prowling mink or weasel sought
the morass. After a while a great frog began
his gruff song. The light faded from the
summer sky and coolness brought relief to
the hot, aching body and parched mouth of
the boy. Hope revived in his breast. That
King Philip had spared him so long argued
well, he believed, for ultimate freedom. He
doubted not that the fagots at his feet would
have been lighted had not some diversion,
dimly recalled, interrupted the sachem’s intent.
The departure of the company, armed
and in war-paint, could mean but one thing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
battle with the English, and David prayed
fervently that Philip would be defeated and
his band scattered. And then: “Aye, but
what will be my fate in such case?” he asked
himself. “None know of my plight save
these Indians, and hence none will come to
release me! I doubt I can survive another
day of this torture. It seems that whatever
happens I am doomed!”</p>

<p>The realization produced a panic of mind
that set him writhing and twisting at his
bonds and accomplishing naught save to add
to his pain and exhaustion. At last, discouraged,
limp and panting, he gave up, and at
that moment a voice came to him through
the darkness.</p>

<p>“Brother!”</p>

<p>After an instant of surprise, David answered,
hope rushing into his heart again.
“Who calls?” he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“Memecho.” The voice seemed to come
from some distance. “Who are you and why
are you bound?”</p>

<p>“My name is David Lindall. This morning
Philip’s men captured me near here. I
was seeking the garrison at Brookfield. For
a month, may be, I have been held hostage
by the Wachoosetts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, I know of you, brother. Monapikot,
a Pegan, has told us your story.”</p>

<p>“Monapikot! He is hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“I said not so.” The Indian lowered his
voice. “Better it is to talk little, David, for
we know not who hears.”</p>

<p>“You are a friend? Will you not cut
these cords of mine, Memecho?”</p>

<p>“Aye, so soon as you cut mine! I cannot
help you, brother, for I am both bound and
wounded.”</p>

<p>David’s heart sank. And yet even the
presence and the voice of a friend was something
to be thankful for, and after a moment
he said:</p>

<p>“I grieve for you, Memecho. How happened
this wound?”</p>

<p>“I fought with the English by Wickabaug
Pond some hours ago. They sought the Quaboags
to make a treaty with them and were
set upon in ambush and had many killed
and wounded. I, who led the English captains,
was shot in the first volley from the
swamp beside me, and, when I had fallen,
could not follow back along the path and so
was taken and brought hither.”</p>

<p>“Is your wound of consequence, brother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, ’twill heal if it be given time, but
my arm is of no use to me.”</p>

<p>“You say the English had many killed,
Memecho? And what happened at last?”</p>

<p>“They went back, still fighting, to the garrison,
the Quaboags pursuing. Now they are
beset by my people in great number and unless
help come must perish.”</p>

<p>“Is there help near, Memecho?”</p>

<p>“’Tis said that Major Willard has half a
hundred soldiers under him at Lancaster,
on the Nashua, thirty miles away. Yet unless
word be taken to him what means it?
One who sought to go at Captain Wheeler’s
command was killed ere he had ridden an
arrow’s flight. And now, since the village is
surrounded, none may pass out.”</p>

<p>“Had I but my freedom!” groaned David.</p>

<p>“Or I mine,” said the Indian.</p>

<p>“How happens it that you talk my language
so well, Memecho?” asked the boy,
after a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“I am of the Praying Village at Chabanakongkomun,
a Christian like yourself, David.
I have learned to speak your language
and to read and write it, though the writing
is hard for me. I teach my brothers, or so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
did I until this infidel Philip pillaged and
drove us forth. It may be now—<em>what sound
was that?</em>”</p>

<p>David listened. “I heard nothing, Memecho.
Whither came it?”</p>

<p>“Be still, brother!”</p>

<p>And then David himself heard. From a
little distance came the crackling of a twig,
a tiny sound enough, but momentous to
those who hearkened. Silence followed. David
strained his ears. It might well be no
more than a beast of the forest, and yet hope
told another tale. After what seemed a long
time, a swishing sound in the rushes nearer
at hand turned his eyes sharply to the left.
At first naught was to be seen in the gray
darkness. Then, vague, formless, something
emerged from the gloom close beside him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<small>DAVID BEARS A MESSAGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Noawama!”</p>

<p>“<em>Pikot!</em>” gasped David.</p>

<p>“Softly!” answered the voice of the Indian,
now beside him. “Speak little and
hearken much. There is little time for talk.”
Monapikot’s knife slashed the thongs that
held David, and then, as the boy would have
fallen without their support, took him into
his arms and laid him gently on the ground.
“Rest,” he whispered, “for there is a journey
before you. I will return after a minute.”</p>

<p>The Pegan stole away and David heard
the murmuring of voices where Memecho lay.
Presently both Indians were beside him and
Monapikot lifted him to his feet. “Can you
walk, David?” he asked.</p>

<p>David tried, but would have fallen save
for the other’s hold on him. “Slowly,” bade
the Pegan. “Put your weight on my shoulder
and try again, Noawama.”</p>

<p>In this manner, with Memecho following,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
David left the marsh island. Gradually the
use of his limbs returned to him, although
each nerve and muscle ached intolerably and
movement sent his head to spinning. But
presently they were on dry ground in a forest
of great trees widely spaced, and there they
halted.</p>

<p>Monapikot spoke. “The garrison is in
sore danger, my brothers, and aid must come
soon. These plans had I made. Westward,
at Hadley, are two English captains with
many men. I meant to go thither and summon
them. To the north and east is Major
Willard, if report be true, by a place called
Lancaster. To him would I have sent you,
Memecho. But now I know not, for with
your wound you are not fit to go.”</p>

<p>“I will try, Monapikot,” answered Memecho
sturdily, but with a voice that told of
suffering.</p>

<p>“Nay,” broke in David eagerly, “give me
directions for the journey, Pikot! ’Tis but
thirty miles and surely I can win there by
dawn! My strength is already returned,
Pikot. Memecho is not fit for the task. Say
I may go!”</p>

<p>“Aye, my brother, for I but waited for
your word. Go, then, and when you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
found this English major say to him that
Monapikot of the Pegans bids him come in
all haste. Say to him that the garrison at
Brookfield numbers less than a hundred and
is besieged by four times that many. Say to
him that the English may hold out until the
day after the morrow, but no later, and that
I go to Hadley to ask relief of Captain
Lothrop. From the pond that lies a league
north leads a stream and beside it runs the
path you must follow. When you have traveled
three leagues farther the stream will be
a river. That is the Nashua, David, and it
will bring you to Lancaster village. By day
your journey may be made more short, but
in darkness ’tis better to let the river show
the way. Here is food, though scanty. Seek
not to haste at first, Noawama, but let your
strength return. Are you thirsty?”</p>

<p>“Aye, my throat is parched, indeed,
Straight Arrow.”</p>

<p>“Water you will find but a little way from
here, but do not drink deeply. Take but
enough to cool your throat. Go now, for
time passes. Wait! Take this knife. I can
offer no more.”</p>

<p>“But you, Pikot? Will you not need it?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I shall find another ere my journey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
is well begun,” replied the Pegan grimly.
“Farewell, Noawama! God watch over
you.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, Pikot. We shall meet again in
two days!”</p>

<p>“Be it so. Come, Memecho.”</p>

<p>With a last glance toward the Indians in
the starlight gloom of the forest, David
turned and sought the trail. Slowly he went
at first, for, despite his protestation to Pikot,
his limbs were still unequal to their task. As
the Indian had promised, his way crossed
a small brook but a few rods beyond and
the boy knelt and let the water dwell gratefully
in his mouth, but, heeding Pikot’s
warning, took but a swallow of it ere he
arose and went on again. The path was ill-defined
in the darkness and was seemingly
little used, but only once did he wander from
it and then speedily found it again. And so,
his strength growing each moment, he came
at last to the pond he sought.</p>

<p>It was small, and he had soon reached the
upper end of it, from which led a quiet,
meandering stream. On the western bank, a
rude trail followed the brook on its northward
flow. There was little water between
the low banks, for the summer had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
hot and dry, and for stretches David found
the parched, sun-cracked margin of the
stream offering better footing than the path.
After an hour stream and trail both widened
and bore eastward. The necessity for caution
and the roughness of the path had thus far
precluded speed, but now, when the brook
had flowed into a second pond and emerged
more worthy the name of river, David found
himself able to take up the swinging trot he
had learned from the savages. Unlike them,
however, he could not maintain that pace
for long, and soon he was obliged to fall back
to a walk. During the first portion of his
journey he rested frequently, throwing himself
full-length on the ground and relaxing
his tired body, but as time wore on his power
of endurance seemed to grow rather than
diminish and rest became less imperative until
well toward the end. He kept eyes and
ears constantly on guard, for this was a well-traveled
path that he followed and at any
moment he might encounter foes, and it was
well that he did so, for, near midnight as he
judged it to be, some sense, whether of sight
or hearing he knew not, warned him of danger
and he drew quickly aside into the thicket
and crouched silently in the darkness. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
moment later, with scarce a sound, the form
of an Indian came into sight against the sky,
traveling westward, the body bent forward
and the arms trailing in the tireless trot of
his kind. At intervals of a few paces four
others followed. Unsuspecting and looking
neither to left nor right, the savages passed
swiftly along the trail and were gone. For
some minutes David waited in concealment.
Then he went on again.</p>

<p>That was not the only alarm, for an hour
or so later, where the stream and path led
through a long swamp of alder and willow
and rustling cattail, a sudden floundering and
splashing but a few yards distant brought
his heart to his mouth and held him for a
long moment motionless on the path. But
this alarm presaged no danger, for the sound
was only that of some huge animal, probably
a moose, disturbed and in flight. Occasionally
river and trail parted company, as when
the former cut its way through a narrow
gorge of slaty rock and the latter mounted
a little hill where, against the starlight,
laurel and sweet-fern grew abundantly. But
always they came together again sooner or
later, and never was he for more than a moment
or two out of sound of the river’s murmur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
and gurgle. Weariness was claiming
him now as, ahead of him, the night sky
began to light above the mysterious hills.
Slumber called him and it needed all his
courage and determination to resist its alluring
voice. Perhaps it was only the knowledge
of what his mission meant to the beleaguered
inhabitants of the garrison back
there at Brookfield that kept him somehow
on his aching feet to the end. The last three
hours of that journey became a waking nightmare
of which, afterwards, he could recall
little beyond the sheer suffering that he underwent.
Dawn came up slowly out of the
east and found him skirting a great forest
of pines and hemlocks. The gray lightness
showed his uncertain sight a cluster of cabins
that dotted the plain ahead. A rude stockade
fort caught the first yellow glint of the sun on
its newly peeled logs. The river turned and
left him to struggle on by a side path through
coarse grass and trailing briers that caught at
his faltering feet and thrice sent him sprawling
to the dewy earth. Each time it took
great toll of his strength to lift himself again
and stagger on. And then the log wall of a
little house suddenly barred his way and in
the midst of a great feeling of thankfulness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
he felt his way to the door and, dropping to
the stone step below, beat weakly on the stout
oak planks.</p>

<p>There they found him a minute or two
later when, doubtfully, they unbarred the
door and peered out. He was sound asleep
then, but as willing hands lifted him across
the threshold he awakened startledly.</p>

<p>“Major Willard?” he whispered. “I
bring a message to him from Brookfield.
He—is here?”</p>

<p>“Nay, but close by. Give me your message
and I will bear it, lad.”</p>

<p>“Monapikot, the Pegan, bids him haste
to Brookfield. The Indians have attacked.
Many English are slain. The garrison is besieged—by
four hundred or more. Philip
leads them.” David’s voice faltered. “There
is more, but I—forget!” His head fell back
and he slept again.</p>

<p>An hour only they gave him, and then he
awoke to find the small room with its homely
and scanty furnishings, so like his own home,
filled with grave-faced men. One in soldier’s
accouterment sat on the edge of the pallet,
a lean-countenanced man whose long,
straight nose and wide-set eyes spoke courage
and wisdom.</p>

<p>“Now, lad, your name and story, and
quickly,” he said with kindly imperiousness.</p>

<p>David gathered his scattered faculties and
answered, and while he spoke those who had
gathered close to listen murmured their surprise,
horror, indignation, and, when it had
become evident that the boy on the pallet had
traveled that trail in some ten hours, admiration.</p>

<p>“Well done, in sooth!” exclaimed Major
Simon Willard heartily when David had
ended. “You are a brave boy, David, and
there is one not far who will be prouder of
your courage than I! Bide you here and
rest you, lad. Mistress Farwell will look to
your wants and when we return you shall be
sent safely to your home. Unless, mayhap,
your father has other views. That we shall
determine later.” He turned to the others
and sprang to his feet. “You have heard,
masters! To horse, then, and let us push forward,
for the road is long and our presence
is sore needed. I give you good-day, young
sir!”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, an it please you,” cried David,
clutching at the Major’s doublet. “Take me
with you, I beg. I can fight, sir! And I am
well and strong again, now that I have slept.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, my lad, methinks you have earned
a season of rest as well as our gratitude.
Bide you here. Doubtless Mistress Farwell
will find you Christian apparel of sorts. And
that were well since your present state is
like to fright the maids out o’ their wits!”</p>

<p>The Major smiled and turned away. Already
the room was empty save for a few,
and through an open casement David could
see the company preparing to mount.</p>

<p>“Sir, the odds be greatly against us at
Brookfield, for Philip and the sagamores who
fight with him have fully four hundred savages
against much less than a hundred of the
English, and I am no poor hand with a musket.”
David interposed himself between the
soldier and the door and spoke earnestly.
“Every one who can fight will be needed, sir.
I pray you provide me with a musket and
let me return with you.”</p>

<p>Major Willard frowned. “’Tis plain your
perseverance has survived the task you set it,
David, but I doubt your father would look
kindly on me were I to grant your request.
Besides, horses are few—”</p>

<p>“I can go afoot,” exclaimed David eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nor am I certain that a musket could be
found for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>“Then will I fight with bow and arrows,
sir!”</p>

<p>Major Willard threw his hands apart and
laughed shortly. “Do as you will. An you
can fight as you argue ’twere a pity to leave
you behind! But I take no blame, young
sir, and so you must tell your father. And if
he says you nay, count not on me for support.
Now I will find if there be a horse for
you. Mistress Farwell, give this lad food
and speed him forth.”</p>

<p>“What meant he by my father saying me
nay?” David asked himself as he drew a
stool to the table and the food laid thereon
by his hostess. “’Tis far from likely that
he will know aught about it until I return
home, by which time his yea or nay will matter
little, methinks!”</p>

<p>He ate quickly of the food, fearful lest the
company be off without him, unconscious of
the curious glances cast upon him by the children
gathered without the open door. Nor,
indeed, was he aware of their presence there
until, thrust from behind, they flowed into
the house. This small commotion drew his
eyes from the window, and in the next instant
he was on his feet, staring unbelievingly
at the two men who came quickly
through the portal.</p>

<small>TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>David’s startled cry drowned the sound of
the overturned stool as he sprang toward the
foremost of the two men.</p>

<p>“Aye, David,” answered Nathan Lindall
in his quiet voice, taking the boy into his
arms with a mighty hug. “Art well?”</p>

<p>“But—but how happens it you are
here?” stammered David. “Is it really you?
I can scarce believe my eyes! And Obid,
too!”</p>

<p>“What be left o’ me,” replied Obid Dawkin
grimly.</p>

<p>But he smiled as David took his hand and
threw an arm over his shoulders, and there
was a suspicious moistness in his pale eyes
for some moments after.</p>

<p>“’Tis a long story, lad,” Nathan Lindall
was saying, “and ’twill keep till we be on
our way; for Major Willard tells me that
naught will do but that you must accompany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
us. So, if you have finished your repast, we
will be going. I would never have known
you, David, in this guise had I met you on
the trail. Does he not make a fine young
brave, Obid?”</p>

<p>“I grant you,” answered Obid sourly, eyeing
the boy askance, “but I’d as lief he aped
the Devil himself, master. I’ve seen enough
of the ungodly cannibals without having one
in the family!”</p>

<p>Laughing, Nathan Lindall, an arm still
about his son’s shoulders, thanked Mistress
Farwell and led the way outside. A few
minutes later the company set forth. Four
friendly Indians led the way. Of these one,
as David noted with surprise, was his old
acquaintance, Joe Tanopet, still wearing his
green waistcoat. The Indians were unmounted.
Behind them, in company with
two younger officers, rode Major Willard, a
fine and martial figure on his white steed.
Followed the company of dragoons, each
man fully armed with musket and baldric.
Some wore, besides, a hunting-knife thrust
into a leather belt. In all the company numbered
fifty-three. David had been supplied
with a horse, a small, flea-bitten gray mare
with a dejected mien, and musket and ammunition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
It was shortly after eight o’clock
when the little force left Lancaster and, fording
the river above the settlement, took a
broad trail into the west, which, more direct
than that following the stream, nevertheless
proved later to be a most arduous one, crossing
many hills and floundering through quagmires
innumerable.</p>

<p>But David had little thought for the road,
for there was much to learn and to tell, and
when the trail allowed he rode his mare
close to his father’s side and listened or
talked. Nathan Lindall told of the journey
with Master Vernham and others to the
Wachoosett village and of its unsatisfactory
result.</p>

<p>“Metipom received us as friends and gave
a feast in our honor, but we were not deceived.
Yet none would say that they had
seen aught of you, though Tanopet spoke
aside with many of the tribe. In the end,
finding no trace of you, we must needs depart
with what grace we might, although
William Vernham was for enticing the sachem
outside the palisade and making prisoner
of him, a fanciful plan that we would
not countenance. Had I not been assured
that no harm would befall you so long as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
Metipom’s son went scatheless, I should have
returned with an armed force and brought
things to a head. But, as circumstances
stood, for the Council at Boston would not
countenance aught likely to interrupt the
existing friendship between the Wachoosett
tribe and the English, it seemed better to
wait. I will not say, lad, that I was not
troubled for you, and when Monapikot
brought word that he had seen and talked
with you and that you were well I was
greatly relieved.”</p>

<p>“He gave you my message, father?”</p>

<p>“Aye, lad, but two days later.”</p>

<p>“I could not understand Pikot’s presence
there with those others, father, nor do I yet.
’Twas hard to believe him not a traitor, since
they fetched with them the dried heads of
two of our people and sought to embroil
Metipom in Philip’s quarrel.”</p>

<p>“He did not tell you, then?”</p>

<p>“He said only that I must trust him,
which I did, though not without misgiving.”</p>

<p>“He keeps a secret well, but now that you
have so well proved yourself, David, I see
no reason why you should not know the truth
about the Pegan. You may remove all suspicion
of him from your mind, my son, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
Monapikot is a true and tried friend of the
Colony, more trusted than any other of his
race. Indeed, never since the days of the
Pequot War has there been known a spy of
such courage and wisdom.”</p>

<p>“A <em>spy</em>! Pikot a <em>spy</em>?”</p>

<p>“Aye, does it surprise you so?”</p>

<p>“I had not thought,” stammered David.
“And it sorrows me. Always I have thought
of a spy as one base and mean and unworthy,
and to think so of Monapikot—”</p>

<p>“A spy is base only when he be apprehended,”
replied Nathan Lindall dryly. “Is
it right to call one mean who takes far
greater risks than any other and for no more
return? He who fights in open combat may
look for honorable treatment if captured,
but the spy well knows that speedy death is
aught he may win in such case. Nay, David,
Monapikot deserves your praise and not your
censure. No better nor more useful friend
have the English to-day, for his ways of
learning what we would know are many and
marvelous. For several years he has served
the Colony and never yet has he failed at
aught he has been set to do. I hold it a
miracle that he has so far escaped, for a
dozen times has he put his head in the lion’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
mouth, as when, but last month, he visited
King Philip’s village at Pocasset and brought
back news of that infidel’s intent. But to
continue my story.</p>

<p>“This Nausauwah, son of Metipom, was
lately brought to trial, and, although the evidence
against him was not pressed lest the result
should be his death and your undoing, yet
he was adjudged a menace and deported to
one of the islands in Boston Harbor, there to
be held until peace is restored. Fearing the
news of this would reach Metipom and that
he would wreak vengeance on you, I applied
to the Council for assistance and, as Pikot
had brought word of the Wachoosetts’ disaffection,
Major Willard was instructed to
go to their village, take prisoners, and rescue
you. To this end, four days since, the Major’s
command visited the Wachoosett village,
I and Obid accompanying them. But
we found only a desert. Our guides soon
found the signs of their departure, but the
trail was already cold and pursuit was
deemed ill-advised until we had added to our
force. Yesterday twenty more dragoons
joined us from Groton and to-day we were
to have followed Metipom.”</p>

<p>“He lodges near to Brookfield, father, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
has joined forces with Philip. I am fain that
all who have proven traitors to their promises
of good behavior be punished, father, and
yet many of the Wachoosett tribe have
treated me kindly and it would grieve me
to see ill come to them.”</p>

<p>“’Tis difficult in these times to pick the
sheep from the goats, David,” replied his father
gravely. “I doubt not many innocent
will be punished with the guilty. I’ve heard
tell that at the Plymouth Colony so incensed
are our people against the Indians that ’tis
enough to have a red skin to merit death.
Even about Boston the people are strangely
panic-stricken and accept without question
all the stories, no matter how improbable,
that come to them. Mr. Eliot’s Indians have
come under suspicion and there is talk of removing
them from the villages and holding
them prisoners on some island in the harbor.
It is said that some have proven false and
taken the war-path with Philip. I do not
know how true it be, but, on the other hand,
a great many are fighting on our side, and
methinks they so even the matter. Obid,
howsomever, declares that those who have
taken arms for the English do so but the
better to betray us later. He has changed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
none in his opinion of the savages since you
left us, David.” Nathan Lindall smiled
dryly.</p>

<p>“But how came he to accompany you,
father? I had not thought ever to see him
bearing a musket and going a-soldiering!”</p>

<p>“An I mistake not, lad, he is as surprised
to find himself where he is as you or I! He
has no liking for this work, but came out of
love for you and devotion to me, David. I
think could he have had his way he would
have marched alone into the Wachoosett
country so soon as you were stolen, and
sought your rescue! If, as I believe, it be the
rarest courage to do what you fear to do,
then is Obid the bravest man I know. He is
convinced beyond all argument that he is
doomed to be scalped and so spends much
time each day in the nice arrangement of
his hair. But now tell me of how affairs
stand at Brookfield. Has this Sagamore-John
indeed joined up with Philip, as ’tis
rumored?”</p>

<p>“Of him I have heard naught, father, but
I believe that all the Nipmucks in that part
of the country have gathered to Philip’s aid
or will do so shortly unless they be taught
a speedy lesson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>“Which they shall be taught,” responded
Nathan Lindall grimly. “But I pray the
garrison may hold out until we reach them.
’Tis but slow progress we make, lad.”</p>

<p>At noon the company paused a short while
for rest and food. They were then on high
land overlooking a wide and pleasant valley
and had conquered a good half of their distance.
Major Willard summoned his officers
to him, by courtesy including Nathan Lindall,
and plans were made for when they
should approach the beleaguered village.
Whether their coming was suspected or not
by the Indians, they could not hope to gain
the garrison’s protection without a battle unless,
having halted at a distance, they
awaited darkness and entered the village by
stealth. In that wise they might escape a
serious encounter. Some were for marching
straight to the village by daylight, trusting to
the notably poor marksmanship of the Indians
to win past without great loss, but in
the end the decision was to tarry a mile or so
away and send scouts ahead to learn the disposition
and strength of the foe and then go
forward under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>The last ten miles of the way presented
grave difficulties to them. The trail, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
well enough for one afoot, abounded in
swampy stretches too treacherous for the
horses, and twice wide detours were made
that added distance and consumed time. Yet
at an hour before sunset the company reached
a position something above a mile from the
village on the north and a halt was called
where stream and grass offered refreshment
for the tired steeds. Thus far not an Indian
enemy had been sighted, although, as David
reckoned it, they had passed within a
league of the Wachoosett encampment and
were fairly within the demesne of the Quaboags.
Two of the guides were dispatched
toward Brookfield to reconnoiter, while the
others were posted on either side to prevent
a surprise. Food was partaken of in silence
while the last slanting rays of sunlight filled
the copse with mellow beauty. An hour
passed. Then a distant musket shot was
heard. Instantly a second followed it, and
soon the firing was fairly continuous.</p>

<p>“The devils have begun a new attack,”
muttered Major Willard. “I would our
scouts were back.”</p>

<p>They came soon after, creeping stealthily
from the brush. The Indians to the number
of three hundred or more were disposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
about the village, they reported, sheltering
in houses and barns. The garrison house still
held out. They had seen Wampanoags, Wachoosetts,
Quaboags, and a few River Indians.
King Philip himself they had not
descried. The Indians were armed with guns
to about half their number. Many houses
had already been burned and others were
then in flames. The Indians had been feasting
and drinking, and much loot was assembled
at the edge of the town. To reach
the village it would be best to make a detour
toward the west and approach by a portion
wherein more houses had been burned and
where the enemy found fewer places of concealment.
It might even be possible to attain
to within a short distance of the garrison
before discovery since the besiegers seemed
to have set few guards on any side.</p>

<p>When twilight had well deepened, the
guides set forth again and the dragoons got
to saddle and followed. After a half-mile
march through forest paths they halted again.
Eastward the darkening sky was red with
the reflection of the burning village and shots
sounded incessantly. Now and then, since
they had come to within no more than half
a mile of the settlement, a shrill, shuddering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
war-cry reached them through the still evening.
Fortunately for them, the sky was now
overcast and there was a feel of rain in the
sultry air. Northwards, lightning began to
play above the hill-tops.</p>

<p>Presently a further advance was made in
all silence and then the company dismounted
and the horses were led into a small glade
and picketed. After which, having seen to
their arms, the company set forth afoot, led
by the guides, through the darkness of early
night in the direction of the flame-lit sky.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<small>THE ATTACK ON THE GARRISON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>By a miracle, as it seemed, they reached the
edge of the woods undetected, and from there,
pausing a moment, had their first view of the
distressed village. The firing had diminished
somewhat, though from the garrison house,
which stood, readily distinguished in the light
of the burning buildings, near the center of
the settlement, a flash now and then told of a
musket shot. Between the rescue party and
the beleaguered garrison many buildings had
been burned, but the ruins, some still glowing
and smouldering, afforded protection and
served to hide their approach to some extent.
Skulking forms flitted about in the lurid
gloom, and under the lee of a still standing
granary many Indians were to be seen gathered
at some task not apparent from such
distance.</p>

<p>Major Willard spoke, softly and the company
crept from the concealment of the forest,
keeping as best they might under cover
of the blackened ruins. A dozen yards were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
traversed without alarm. Then a cry went
up from the darkness at their left and an
arrow sped past them. A dragoon at David’s
side stopped and fired, and simultaneously
there was a groan from one farther in
advance and he sank into the arms of a comrade.
The Indians were firing at them now
from the direction of the granary with muskets,
while a number of arrows came from
other points. Carrying the wounded man,
they dashed across the intervening ground
toward the garrison. From the loopholes of
that building flashes told that they had been
seen and that those within were seeking to
protect them with their fire. From the moment
of the alarm until they had reached the
portal of the garrison was but a scant space
of time, and so sudden had been their appearance
that the enemy, surprised, confused,
and, doubtless, uncertain as to their strength
of numbers, presented small opposition. It
was not until they were crowding through
the door that the Indians began to fire upon
them in earnest. Then, since they were well
shadowed, the bullets and arrows did them no
hurt save that one man received a trifling
wound in his hand.</p>

<p>Their appearance was the signal for great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
rejoicing amongst the inhabitants of the garrison,
who, as it was proved, numbered about
eighty all told. Captain Wheeler was in command.
Captain Hutchinson, who had been
sorely wounded the day before, lay on a pallet
in the upper story. So far but one of the
garrison had been killed and one wounded
since they had taken refuge there. The Indians
had attacked ferociously last night and
again early in the afternoon, exposing themselves
far more than was usual to the fire of
the defenders, so that it was reckoned more
than half a hundred had been killed. Of the
relief from Hadley nothing had been seen or
heard. Many of the garrison from constant
fighting were wearied almost beyond endurance,
and with the arrival of the reënforcements,
these were sent to rest themselves
while the dragoons took their places at the
firing-holes. Food and ammunition were
plentiful, though with fifty more on hand the
water supply might soon give out unless all
partook sparingly.</p>

<p>David took his place beside his father
where a view of the village to the right of
the garrison house was presented. It was
from that direction that the next attack was
expected, they learned. For nearly half an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
hour the Indians had been quieter and it was
believed that they were preparing a new attempt
to set fire to the house. Many times
they had tried it, since they had found that
bullets and arrows profited them little. Last
night they had dipped bundles of rags in oil
and tied them to long poles and with those
attempted to creep near enough to attain
their fiendish object. But each time the fire
from the garrison had defeated them. They
had likewise tried fire-arrows, but with even
poorer success. What new device they were
considering remained to be seen.</p>

<p>It now seemed that the enemy was angered
by the arrival of the relief, or, perhaps, at
their own outwitting, for they fell to the attack
with redoubled fury, firing from all sides.
Seldom were the besiegers visible to those
within the garrison, or, if visible, they were
seen so uncertainly that accurate shooting
was difficult. Yet muskets were discharged
whenever opportunity afforded and quickly
loaded again. The stench of powder became
well-nigh intolerable within the house.</p>

<p>While the firing was heaviest an exclamation
from his father caused David to blink
his smarting eyes and peer more closely into
the outer gloom. From around a corner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
the granary came some dark object that
puzzled all who gazed. But in another moment,
when the flickering light from a near-by
conflagration fell upon it, it was revealed
as a cart piled high with hemp and flax and
such like combustibles. Already fire was
licking it with red tongues. In what manner
it was propelled was a mystery at first. Then,
as it came nearer, it was seen that the Indians
had spliced many long poles together,
and so, from the shelter of the darkness and
shadows beyond, were pushing it backwards
toward the building.</p>

<p>“An that thing reaches us we be doomed,”
muttered Nathan Lindall, resting his cheek
to his musket as he peered forth.</p>

<p>“I see none to aim at, father,” said David.</p>

<p>“Nor I, forsooth! The villains have found
them a pretty strategy!”</p>

<p>“There’s naught for it save to charge forth
and upset the cart ere it touches the house!”
cried one. “Else we shall be roasted alive
here!”</p>

<p>At that instant a great clap of thunder
burst overhead that shook the earth and for
the instant silenced the uneasy clatter of
tongues. Then silence once more, a silence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
in which no musket shot broke, in which the
besiegers themselves seemed stricken to inaction
and fear. The burning cart had
stopped at a short distance, its contents now
flaming prodigiously and, as it happened,
lending aid to those in the house, for by its
light the Indians who pushed from the end
of the long pole appeared dimly in the background.
A dozen shots burst together from
the garrison and some of the Indians dropped
or staggered away. But others took their
places and again the cart came forward. At his
loophole David could now feel the warmth
of the flames. Suddenly what had escaped
him before became apparent, which was that
back of the cart, so close it was a marvel
that their naked bodies were not scorched
by the heat, three savages pushed, trusting
to the bulk of the cart to escape detection.
But now the flames had revealed them, and
with a sudden fierce exultation David drew
down the muzzle of his gun until it covered
the breast of one who, not without a courage
worthy a better use, plodded in fair sight
behind the cart. The boy’s finger pressed
upon the trigger, and then a leaping flame
threw its ruddy light full on the Indian’s
countenance and David’s finger relaxed. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
the face was the face of Sequanawah, captain
of the Wachoosetts!</p>

<p>Many thoughts rushed through the boy’s
mind in that tiny instant of time. He recalled
Sequanawah’s numerous kindnesses, his declaration
of friendship, his sorrow at parting.
He had but to press that trigger a shade more
and the Indian’s soul would go back to his
Maker, for the naked breast lay a fair target
below him.</p>

<p>“<em>Shoot!</em>”</p>

<p>It was his father’s voice, almost drowned
by the concussion of his own gun as he strove
to send a bullet into the brain of one of Sequanawah’s
companions. David’s heart contracted
and the finger on the trigger again
pressed tauter. But that instant of hesitation
had made the difference between life and
death to the Wachoosett. With a final thrust,
the burning cart crashed against the house
and the flames licked the boards and flared
as high as the upper windows. And in the
self-same moment a great flash of lightning
blazed over the world, paling the ruddy
flames in its white intensity. So unforeseen
and alarming was it that those at the firing-holes
fell back with gasps of fright. A terrific
blast of thunder followed it, and the house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
shook in every timber. When David sprang
again to his post Sequanawah and those who
had dared with him were gone. Close to the
granary some forms emerged swiftly into the
shadows and disappeared from his sight.
From below came cries of alarm and consternation,
for the flames from the cart were
already eating at the building.</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed Nathan Lindall.
“The granary is on fire! A lightning bolt
has struck it!”</p>

<p>So it was, and David, peering forth, saw
not only the flames bursting from the high-peaked
roof, but the forms of many Indians
swiftly fleeing from its shelter. One shot he
sped, and then a second time the heavens
opened with appalling radiance, again the
thunder crashed, and, ere its last rumble had
died away, from the sundered sky descended
a torrent of rain such as none there had ever
witnessed!</p>

<p>Straight down it came, a veritable cataract,
and the noise of its falling on the shingled
roof close above their heads was well-nigh
deafening. Gazing into it was like looking
through a solid sheet of water. For an instant
only the flames of the burning houses
showed through the hissing deluge. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
only blackness was left on every side. The
burning cart resisted longer, but that, too,
was soon out, and through the house heartfelt
expressions of joy and thanksgiving
arose.</p>

<p>“Now has the Lord by a miracle delivered
us from our enemies!” cried Nathan Lindall.
“Blessed be the name of Our Lord!”</p>

<p>“Amen!” answered all who heard.</p>

<p>Though the rain was ended in less than an
hour, it had served to so dampen the enemy’s
spirits that not again during the night did he
renew the attack. Darkness and silence
shrouded the garrison so soon as the storm
had rumbled away into the south. There was
sleep for some, while others remained on
guard, and to all came a new hope and encouragement.
Even Captain Hutchinson, in
bad case though he was from wounds that
caused his death many days later, spoke
words of cheer from his bed of pain.</p>

<p>It proved a long night, but morning
dawned at last bringing clear skies and radiant
sunlight, the latter serving to accentuate
the desolation that met the sorrowful view
of the townsfolk. Sodden heaps of blackened
ruins lay on every side. Only a few
scattered houses remained undamaged. The
granary had escaped demolition, though a
part of its roof was gone. At daybreak food
was eaten and a service of prayer and thanksgiving
held in the garrison house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>It was shortly after that a friendly Indian,
several of whom had shared the plight
of the defenders, uttered an alarm from his
place of watching. From the woods on the
west of the devastated village came an Indian
running fast and straight toward the
garrison house. Already a few savages had
been seen skulking about the outskirts beyond
range of bullet, but this one was not
of them. As David, peering forth with the
others, beheld and wondered, arrows sped
toward the runner from a patch of woods at
his right. They missed their mark, and the
Indian, swerving, ran toward the granary
and, with a marvelous burst of speed, reached
it unharmed and placed the building between
him and the enemy. As he came again
into sight about the nearer corner, David
recognized him.</p>

<p>“’Tis Monapikot!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Aye, ’tis the Pegan spy!” called another.
“Unbar the door!”</p>

<p>But Monapikot was not yet safe, for a puff
of smoke arose behind him and a bullet
buried itself in the dirt at his feet. The Indian
who had sighted the Pegan from the
house grunted, thrust his musket through the
firing-hole, and fired. But the distance was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
too great and more shots spat about the runner,
and suddenly, throwing up his hands,
Monapikot whirled in his flight, staggered
and fell flat and limp. David’s heart turned
to stone within him, and then he thrust
aside one who stood in his path and sprang
toward the door.</p>

<p>But his father was before him.</p>

<p>“What would you do?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Bring him in, father! He may not be
dead!”</p>

<p>“Nay, lad, you would but meet the same
fate.”</p>

<p>“I care not! He is my friend, and if it be
that he is but sorely wounded—”</p>

<p>There was a shout from the watchers.
“He is up again! He comes! ’Twas but a
trick he played! The door! The door!”</p>

<p>Swiftly it was unbarred and thrown wide.
David, forgetting danger, dashed through it.
Toward him, swiftly, came the Pegan. An
arrow struck the ground well short and
slithered across the turf. <a href="#i_fp282">Then David was
half pushing, half carrying Monapikot
through the doorway</a>, and then the portal
crashed shut and the great bar fell back into
place. The Pegan would have collapsed had
not hands helped him to a bench whereon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
for a long moment, he sat with hanging head
and laboring lungs. But presently, when water
had been given him, he lifted his head
and smiled at David’s concerned countenance
and then told his story, though in halting
words.</p>

<p>“I bring you word from Captain Lothrop,
at Hadley,” he said. “The Christian Indians
there are unrestful and a party of Nipmucks
have come from Pecomtuck and
threaten trouble. Therefore he sends you
word that he dare not leave Hadley, since
his departure might encourage both the
Christians and the Pecomtucks to attack the
people. I had no trouble in reaching the village,
and there I rested all day yesterday, departing
again last night after darkness. Returning,
I encountered roving parties of Nipmucks
and was twice taken and questioned.
Once I talked myself free, but the next time
they would have carried me back toward
Hadley had I not killed one who held me
and escaped in the darkness. Near to daybreak
I found Nipmucks camped half a mile
west of here and had to go far out of my way
to get past them. The rest you know, brothers;
save that the Wachoosett sachem,
Woosonametipom, lies dead beside the granary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
with six others. I saw no wounds upon
them and do not understand.”</p>

<p>“’Twas the lightning!” exclaimed Captain
Wheeler. “They lay close by the granary,
Pikot?”</p>

<p>“Aye, their bodies be against the wall.”</p>

<p>“So it was, then! The lightning bolt that
struck the granary and set fire to it killed
them at the same instant. It was the hand
of God, neighbors!”</p>

<p>“They did not harm you, Straight Arrow?”
asked David anxiously.</p>

<p>“Nay, I but fell that they might think me
dead. If you have food, I would eat, for I
have traveled fast.”</p>

<p>An hour later, while David and Monapikot
talked, word came that the enemy was again
about to attack and all returned to their stations.
Until just short of noon bullets and
flaming arrows spattered against the house,
but did no damage to the defenders. In the
afternoon one watching from the upper story
reported that many Indians were crossing a
field to the southeast as though in retreat.
By nightfall it was known with certainty
that the siege had been lifted. Despairing of
taking the garrison, the Indians retreated
until, the next day, none was to be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
Scouts, dispatched in many directions, returned
with the tidings that the country was
free of the enemy for six miles around. The
Wachoosett village had been abandoned and
so with all other camps thereabouts, and it
was believed that Philip and his cohorts
were heading westward.</p>

<p>Two days later a party of eight set forth
toward the east. Of these were Nathan Lindall,
David, Obid (still, to his wonderment,
possessed of his scalp), and Monapikot.
With but one alarm and no encounter with
the enemy, they reached safety three days
later, and near the close of a warm August
day David again crossed the threshold of his
home. That evening, in a new and pleasant
feeling of security, for King Philip’s warriors
had thus far given the more settled
country about Boston a wide berth, David
sat and listened, for the most part in contented
silence, to the talk of his father and
Monapikot the Pegan. Now and then, Obid,
busy with his duties about the house, paused
to add his shrill voice to the converse. They
spoke of the war, that for many months
longer was destined to keep the colonists in
uncertainty and terror, and it was Monapikot
rather than Nathan Lindall who spoke hopefully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
of the future and predicted the ultimate
confusion of King Philip.</p>

<p>“He secures victories only where the English
live apart from each other,” said the
Pegan. “To any bold front he turns tail like
a fox. I fear much trouble in the west ere
he finally skulks to cover, but if the Colonies
will join forces and send fighting men upon
him in numbers, he will flee and no more
lives will be taken. He fears the winter that
will soon come, for he has many mouths to
feed, and when the Indian makes war he
gathers no corn. Neither, when the leaves are
off the trees, can he so well give battle, Master
Lindall, and he has no stomach for winter
trails.”</p>

<p>“And what of the Narragansetts, Pikot?
Think you they will fully agree with Philip
and follow him?”</p>

<p>“Aye, master, if the English do not persuade
them otherwise. Bad portents come
from that country and I would that the Governors
gave heed to such.”</p>

<p>They were still in discussion when Master
William Vernham and one of his servants
arrived on horseback, and their neighbor,
dismounting, clasped David in his great arms
and boisterously gave him welcome home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>“A brave and sturdy lad you are, David,”
he declared, “and I would I had one like
you. You are well and unharmed of those
varmints? But an hour ago I got word of
your coming from one who saw you by Sudbury
and I ate my supper in such haste that
it liked to choke me. And you, Master Lindall?
You, too, it seems, have escaped from
the wolves. But I see not Obid. Can it be
that he has—has—”</p>

<p>“Nay, then, master,” responded Obid
from the shadow wherein he sat, “the Lord
brought me safe through, but whether to so
continue or whether in postponement of a
direful fate I know not yet.”</p>

<p>“You are as cheerful as ever,” laughed
William Vernham.</p>

<p>“What I have been through, master, and
the sights my eyes have beheld make not for
cheer.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, and now what for you, David?
Of a surety you will have no mind
for digging the garden and milking and such
like tasks since you have tasted of a soldier’s
life!”</p>

<p>“I know not,” replied David. “It shall
be as my father says, though, an I had my
wish—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>“What, then?” prompted Nathan Lindall
as the boy hesitated.</p>

<p>“Why, then, sir, I would go forth to-morrow
and seek service with those who fight
for the safety of the Colonies. Nor would I
wish to lay aside my musket until this murderous
Philip be driven north or slain.”</p>

<p>“Well said!” cried Master Vernham. “A
lad after my own heart, Nathan Lindall!
You’ll not say him nay, I warrant.”</p>

<p>“He shall have his way,” replied the host
gravely. “Though he knows it not, ’tis arranged
already. Three days from now Monapikot
travels south to the Narragansett
country on a mission you may surmise, Master
Vernham, and ’tis arranged that David
shall accompany him. There may be less
fighting than he craves, but he will be in
good hands and what he performs will be of
service to the Colony.”</p>

<p>“’Tis true, father?” cried David eagerly.
“’Tis true, Straight Arrow?”</p>

<p>The Pegan smiled. “Aye, ’tis true, Noawama.
We take the trail together, you
and I. Danger there will be, though. Wilt
brave it?”</p>

<p>“Try me!” answered David. “With you
I’ll brave aught that comes!”</p>
